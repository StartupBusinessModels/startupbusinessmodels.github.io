<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Glassbridge has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at individual consumers and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Glassbridge offers two primary value propositions: accessibility and innovation.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired several firms since its founding, including Connected Data, Nexsan, ProStor Systems, MXI Security, ENCRYPTX, and Memorex. This strategy has enabled it to greatly expand its capabilities and diversify its portfolio.</p>

<p>The company offers many innovations thanks to its 3M lineage. It has been involved in developing numerous technological improvements in data storage, including the release of the first magnetic tape in 1947, the first quarter-inch tape cartridge for data storage in 1971, and the 3.5-inch floppy disk in 1984.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Glassbridge’s main channels are distributors and value-added resellers. It also sells its offerings through retailers, original equipment manufacturers, and its direct sales team. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, and participation in conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Glassbridge’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Glassbridge’s business model entails designing and developing its software products for customers.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>Glassbridge’s key partners include the suppliers that provide it with the components and semi-finished products it needs to develop its products. They are primarily based in the United States, Mexico, and China. It also depends upon third-party firms to manufacture certain products.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Glassbridge’s main resources are its human resources, who include the engineers that design and develop its products, the sales employees that promote it, and the customer service personnel that provide support.</p>

<p>It places a high priority on intellectual property, with over 180 patents in the United States and several trademarks as of 2015.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Glassbridge has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is sales/marketing, a fixed cost.</p>

<p>Other major drivers are cost of goods sold, a variable expense, and research/development and administration, both fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Glassbridge has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from the sale of its products to customers.</p>

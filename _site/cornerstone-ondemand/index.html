<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Cornerstone OnDemand has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at enterprises, public sector organizations, and nonprofits.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Cornerstone OnDemand offers four primary value propositions: convenience, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for clients. Its solution is cloud-based, enabling clients to reduce maintenance and IT costs and receive automatic updates. The product can also be easily integrated with other platforms and accessed from any device. Lastly, the firm offers a marketplace through which clients can purchase prebuilt integrations to extend its functionality.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific examples of positive outcomes for clients include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Virgin Media used Cornerstone to centralize its learning and performance management system, resulting in a 35% reduction in training time and 15,000 hours in saved administration time</li>
  <li>Walgreens used Cornerstone’s solutions to streamline its performance management system, resulting in a process that was continual rather than just once or twice a year</li>
  <li>The University of Southern California used Cornerstone’s solutions to increase the robustnes of its learning management system, resulting in increased employee access to training modules</li>

  <li>
    <p>Hershey Medical Center used Cornerstone’s solutions to transform its talent management system, resulting in a reduction in the number of versions of onboarding training
 The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality standards. It maintains the Client Success Framework, an operating model identifying an end-to-end process for a successful business relationship with clients. The model highlights key tools for each job role in the client lifecycle. Cornerstone also reduces risk by maintaining high security standards, as follows:</p>
  </li>
  <li>It maintains a multi-tenant, multi-database architecture with the highest uptime and compliance standards. Data is not co-mingled and the infrastructure has numerous certifications.</li>

  <li>Its infrastructure is developed by its IT Security, Privacy, and Compliance team, whose members each hold one or more professional compliance or security certifications.</li>
  <li>
    <p>It enables clients to control the location of their data – specifically by storing it in a specified geography, either in Europe or North America. Backup data is also stored in the same region.
 The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. Its offerings are used by over 2,800 clients worldwide, representing 28 million people in 191 countries and in 42 languages. It has offices in more than 24 countries and has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of over 50% since 2007.

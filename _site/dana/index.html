<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Dana provides a broad range of products to commercial and industrial customers operating within the automotive manufacturing sector. The Company organises its customers primarily into three segments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Light Vehicle Market, comprising manufacturers of light trucks, sports utility vehicles, vans, and passenger cars;</li>
  <li>Medium and Heavy Vehicle Market, comprising manufacturers of medium and heavy duty trucks, buses, and specialty vehicles; and</li>
  <li>Off-Highway Market, comprising manufacturers of specialist vehicles used in construction, earth moving, agriculture, mining, forestry, railways, and material handling.
 Dana includes a number of high-profile companies among its customers, including Ford Motor Company, Toyota Motor Company, General Motors Company, Deere and Company, AGCO Corporation, Caterpillar, and Volkswagen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dana primarily serves customers across its native North American market, which accounted for 53% of its sales in 2015. The Company also serves a range of international customers, through its operations in Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Dana provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Its international reach, with the Company serving an extensive international customer base across Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, in addition to its large domestic customer base;</li>
  <li>Its patented technologies, with the Company utilising proprietary technologies across its product portfolio, making its offerings unique within the automotive industry;</li>
  <li>Its extensive manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, with the Company operating an extensive network of manufacturing and distribution facilities across North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, enabling it to serve customers quickly and efficiently; and</li>

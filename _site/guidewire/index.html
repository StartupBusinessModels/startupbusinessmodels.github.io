<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Guidewire has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at P&amp;C insurance carriers.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Guidewire offers four primary value propositions: convenience, customization, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company’s solution creates convenience. Being web-based, it frees users from the task of installing software on their desktops. Also, its web service APIs allow for the seamless integration of its applications into a service-oriented architecture and interaction with other application types.</p>

<p>The company’s solution enables customization. Users can alter it depending on specific needs and it can be used to support a broad range of operations. It also enables personalization by type of deployment – i.e., by region, functional area, and line of business.</p>

<p>The company’s solution reduces risk. Its programs are built in Java and also conform to the Java EE standard, which is the insurance industry’s preferred technology. Furthermore, Guidewire engages in constant clustering, caching, and performance-tuning to ensure that its applications can handle thousands of simultaneous users. Finally, the firm conducts over 120,000 tests during the development cycle, making the applications trustworthy and reliable.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand as a result of its performance. It serves over 200 insurance companies in over 20 countries worldwide. Prominent clients include AXA, Zurich, Nationwide Insurance, Direct Line Group, and PZU. It has completed more than 300 implementations, investing more than 2,000+ person-years in the R&amp;D process (which it says is more than any other vendor has). Lastly, the company has won many honors. These include the XCelent Award in Celent’s annual “Vendor View” report and recognition as a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for P&amp;C Insurance Policy Management Modules for two years in a row.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Guidewire’s main channel is its direct sales team, which is organized by geographic region. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, publications in industry press, and participation in industry conferences. It also hosts an annual user conference called “Connections”, where customers deliver presentations on insurance technology subjects.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Guidewire’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. It maintains “Guidewire Education”, an education program that offers the following options to customers, employees, and partners: Onsite Training, Virtual Training, and Certification. It also provides general phone and e-mail support. That said, there is a self-service component in the form of Self-Study Training (self-paced online courses), as well as a “Resources” section on the company’s website that includes videos, webinars, white papers, industry analyst reports, and brochures.</p>

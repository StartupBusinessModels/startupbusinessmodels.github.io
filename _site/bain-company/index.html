 The company has demonstrated strong performance through concrete results. It claims that its public clients have historically outperformed the stock market 4 to 1. High-profile examples of specific positive customer outcomes include the following:</p>

  <li>A technology firm used Bain’s services to simplify organizational structures, resulting in a 33% increase in customer-facing selling time and cost savings of more than $25 million</li>
  <li>Two large healthcare firms used Bain’s services during their merger, which resulted in the realization of net synergies 1.6 times the initial target within the first year of the integration

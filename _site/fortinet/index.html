    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-fortinet">Businessmodel of Fortinet</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Fortinet has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customers. It targets its offerings at enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. Its corporate customers come in all sizes and operate in a wide range of industries, including technology, telecommunications, financial services, retail, education, manufacturing, and healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Fortinet offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by making its network operating system flexible enough for implementations of all environments and sizes, from small businesses to carriers. The network security platform has solutions for access (secure access), the edge (next generation firewall), and the core (internal segmentation).</p>

<p>The company enhances performance by providing an end-to-end, integrated offering with solutions for network, application, endpoint, data center, access, and Cloud security. These components work together to create a powerful system, linking varying security sensors to effectively respond to possible threats. The system is able to accomplish this task in real-time with no slowdowns.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated a strong ability to reduce risks. Its solutions are backed up by security services created by FortiGuard Labs. They are regularly verified by entities such as NSS Labs, AV Comparatives, Virus Bulletin, and ICSA to provide top-of-the-line security effectiveness. Specific evaluation results include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A VB Web test noted that FortiGuard Web Filtering stopped 97.7% of direct malware downloads. It is currently the sole filtering service in its sector to have received VB Web certification.</li>
  <li>A VB100 Proactive and Reactive Test selected Fortinet as one of the most effective AV solutions for blocking zero day and known threats.</li>
  <li>AV Comparatives bestowed its top award, the Advanced+ rating, to the company for file detection, anti-phishing, and real-world protection.
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It is the third-largest network security appliance vendor, and has been recognized as the second-largest Data Center Firewall firm. It has more than 270,000 customers, including the majority of the Fortune 500. It has also won many honors, including 2016 recognition as the Network Security Appliance Vendor of the Year (Integrator Awards), the Intelligent Vendor of the Year award (Intelligent CIO Technology Excellence Awards), the Network World ME award in the Network Security Vendor of the Year category, and the Leadership Award for Managed Security Service Providers Market (Frost &amp; Sullivan).</li>
</ul>

The resellers then sell the offerings to end-customers, which include enterprises, service providers, and government agencies. Fortinet also has a sales team that sells its products and services directly to certain end-users. The company promotes its products and services through its website, social media pages, and attendance of seminars, conferences and summits.</p>

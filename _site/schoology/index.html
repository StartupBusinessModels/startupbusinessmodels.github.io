<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>The Company also has data exchange integration partnerships with eSchoolPlus and Tools4ever. Schoology also operates a network of authorised resellers that assist the Company in marketed its platform in new and existing markets.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Schoology’s key resources are its software platform, its IT infrastructure, its personnel and its integration partners. The platform’s community of users could also be considered key resources as they are responsible for much of the platform’s content.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Schoology operates under a freemium revenue model, providing its basic platform to users free of charge with the option of purchasing paid-for premium add-ons and extra features – such as custom branding and support packages – as well as enterprise level packages that include advanced analytics and data integration tools.</p>

<p>Schoology’s enterprise package, aimed at companies and institutions, appears to be its main revenue stream.</p>

<p>However, the Company does not disclose its pricing model on its website nor does it publicly disclose its financial results. Research suggests that the Company’s paid-for enterprise solution appears to be negotiated directly with Company representatives. Some internet sources suggest that the enterprise package is priced at $10 per user as a one-time fee.</p>

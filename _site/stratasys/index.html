</ul>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Stratasys provides value to its customers in three key ways: the quality of its products and services, the status and standing of its brand and its commitment to innovation. Stratasys is a market leader in its field. The quality of its products and its standing within the industry is reflected by its large customer base, including a number of high-profile companies, and its partnerships with leading companies such as Adobe. These strategic alliances also help to ensure that the Company’s keeps pace with the fast-moving technology sector, always providing up-to-date and innovative solutions to its customers.</p>

  <li>sales of systems, related products and services, as well as the Company’s direct manufacturing solutions service, that are made through direct contact with customers.
 There is overlap within these channels, with some independent sales agents for high-end systems also operating as distributors of our other products. Through its consumer three-dimensional printing brand MakerBot, the Company also operates an online sales channel.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Youku Tudou has a multi-sided market business model, with two interdependent customer segments that are both needed in order to operate: producers of video content (professional and amateur) and consumers who view and share the content.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Youku Tudou offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, customization, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by enabling anyone to contribute to its programming. The majority of its content is professionally-produced and licensed from copyright holders. It includes feature films, TV dramas, news programs, animated features, music videos, variety shows, and sports coverage. That said, its platform also allows average Internet users to create, upload, and share their own work – in fact, its slogan is “everyone is a director of life.“</p>

<p>The company enables customization by allowing users to create a personalized channel for video sharing. They can manage their uploads, visitor comments, online friends, and online chats.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by taking significant efforts to protect third-party copyrights – an essential strategy as infringement is a major problem in China’s online video industry. Its invests heavily in copyright protection technologies. These include a video fingerprint system that compares new videos with fingerprint trails of copyrighted videos and a text-filtering system. It also maintains 3,000 full-time and 800 contract employees who engage in copyright checking, content files screening, editing, and source file acquisition. Beyond combatting piracy, Youku Tudou has its in-house reviewers screen all submissions for inappropriate content such as pornography.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is the leading Internet television platform in China, attracting over 580 million monthly unique visitors. Its video content library includes over 5,500 movie titles, 2,600 television serial drama titles, and 540 variety shows. It has also ventured into mobile gaming, and now operates a collection with more than 1,500 games that have generated over 200 million downloads. Lastly, it is one of the world’s largest bandwidth users.</p>

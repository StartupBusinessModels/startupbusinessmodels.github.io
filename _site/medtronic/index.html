This includes patents filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office entitled ‘Adjustable catheter for ostial, septal, and roof ablation in atrial fibrillation patients’, ‘Diagnostic guidewire for cryoablation sensing and pressure monitoring’, and ‘Patient specific data driven safety interlocks for medical devices’.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Medtronic incurs costs in relation to the research and development of its products, the maintenance of its software platforms and IT infrastructure, the operation of manufacturing facilities and acquisition of supplies, the distribution and storage of products and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<p>The Company’s research and development costs are particularly significant, amounting to $1.6 billion in 2015, around 8.1% of the Company’s total sales.</p>

<p>Medtronic also operates a network of offices across and education centres which incur costs in relation to rental and utilities.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Medtronic generates revenue through the development and sale of medical devices and treatments. Its revenue is divided into four business groups: the Cardiac and Vascular Group, the Restorative Therapies Group, the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group and the Diabetes Group.</p>

<p>Medtronic’s largest revenue generator is the Cardiac and Vascular Group, which sells products designed to treat cardiac diseases, provides fee-based data management and reporting solutions – namely its HEARTmark Service, Rethinking Blood Conservation Initiative and Connect HF Solution – and medical operations optimisation services. This business segment generated $9.4 billion in 2015, accounting for around 46% of Medtronic’s total annual revenue. Medtronic’s Restorative Therapies Group – which develops and sells medical devices and implants used in the treatment of the spine and musculoskeletal system, implantable neurostimulation and targeted drug delivery systems, and products and therapies designed to treat ear, nose, and throat diseases – accounted for approximately 33% of the Company’s annual revenue in 2015, generating $6.7 billion.</p>

<p>Medtronic’s Minimally Invasive Therapies Group and Diabetes Group accounted for 12% and 9% respectively, generating $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion in annual revenue. These proportions may change, however, as 2015 revenue figures covered only one quarter of operations following Medtronic’s acquisition of Covidien, which now operates as the Company’s Minimally Invasive Therapies Group.</p>

<p>According to reports from 2015, margins on these products can range from a few percent to a few dozen percent. Shapeways’ revenue model is set to rely principally on commission-based payments for the foreseeable future, however, the Company may begin charging small fees for services such as design advice that are currently available free of charge.</p>

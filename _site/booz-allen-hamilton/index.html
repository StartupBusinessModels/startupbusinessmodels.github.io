<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton provides a broad range of management and technology, consulting, and engineering services to institutional and corporate clients. The Company’s clients can be organized into three principal categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Government Bodies, including local, state, and federal government agencies in the US, as well as various international government bodies;</li>

  <li>Non-Profits, including various non-profit and charitable organisations across the world.
 Over the past year, the majority of Booz Allen Hamilton’s revenue was derived from contracts where the end client was an agency or department of the US Government. The Company supports critical missions for a diverse base of federal government clients, including nearly all of the US Government’s cabinet-level departments, and federal contract vehicles. In the fiscal year 2016, the Company’s largest client was the US Army, which accounted for approximately 15% of the Company’s revenue. The Company also counts the US Navy, US Air Force, Federal Bureau of Investigations, National Security Agency, and the Department of Energy among its longstanding clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>The US continues to be Booz Allen Hamilton’s principal market. The Company’s international clients are primarily based in the Middle East, with the Company also serving a growing presence in Southeast Asia.</p>

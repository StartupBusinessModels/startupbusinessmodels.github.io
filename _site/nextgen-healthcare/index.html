<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>NextGen Healthcare has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at firms in the healthcare industry.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>NextGen Healthcare offers three primary value propositions: convenience, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making operations simpler for its clients.

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Its NextGen Revenue Cycle Management Services solution, which addresses physician billing, has achieved the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decrease in A/R days of 81%</li>
  <li>Achievement of 98% of net collections</li>

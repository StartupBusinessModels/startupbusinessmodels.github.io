The Company’s licence revenue is primarily derived from sales of products targeted at marketing, sales and onboarding, customer service, and operations, while consulting services revenue is principally related to new licence implementations.</p>

<p>The Company also provides training to its customers for a fee. According to its 205 annual report, PegaSystems expects consulting revenue to decrease in future as customers become more accustomed to using the Company’s products and partners begin to lead more projects. The majority of PegaSystems’s revenue is generated in the US, with around 45% generated from outside the US in the past three fiscal years.</p>

<p>In 2015 PegaSystems generated $682.7 million in annual revenue, an increase on the $590 million recorded in 2014. As of 31st December 2015, the Company also had software license, maintenance, cloud, and services agreements with clients expected to result in future revenue of around $580.9 million, of which the Company expects to recognize as much as $336.9 million in 2016.</p>

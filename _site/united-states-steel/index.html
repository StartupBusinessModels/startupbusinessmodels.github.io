<p>US Steel owns and leases a portfolio of properties across the US, Canada, Slovakia, and Brazil. This includes various corporate and sales offices, production and processing facilities, distribution centres, and warehouses.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>US Steel incurs costs in relation to the procurement of raw materials and the management of its supply chain, the operation of its production and processing facilities, the operation and maintenance of its logistics and distribution infrastructure, the management of its partnership, and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<p>In 2015 US Steel recorded cost of sales in the amount of $11.14 billion, including expenses related to the acquisition of raw materials.

<p>In 2015 US Steel generated annual sales of $11.57 billion, down considerably on the $17.51 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. The Company attributed this decrease in sales to decreased shipment volumes and lower average realised prices as a result of challenging market conditions.</p>

<p>The majority of US Steel’s 2015 revenue was generated by the Company’s Flat-Rolled Products segment, which accounted for 8.29 billion in net sales. The bulk of the remaining sales were generated by the US Steel Europe segment, which recorded sales for the year of $2.32 billion.</p>

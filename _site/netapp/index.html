    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-netapp">Businessmodel of NetApp</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>NetApp has a mass market business model, with little differentiation between customers. The company targets its offerings at enterprises, governmental organizations, and service providers.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>NetApp offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by making its products easily usable by the disabled. It incorporates standards into its products specified in the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), which enables its offerings to conform to the U.S. Rehabilitation Act.</p>

<p>The company has a long history of innovation. It is responsible for many industry firsts, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First network-attached storage appliance (FAServer 400)</li>
  <li>First space-saving, no-performance-impact data protection technology using Snapshot copies (Snapshot)</li>
  <li>First network-based data-backup protocol (NDMP)</li>
  <li>First NAS appliance to integrate storage with Oracle applications</li>
  <li>First to enable a converged 10Gb Ethernet network that supports storage protocols and workloads on a single wire</li>
  <li>First to extend data center agility by enabling scale-out across low-, mid-, and high-end unified NAS and SAN systems</li>
  <li>
    <p>First to offer clustering for nondisruptive operations, resource provisioning, and rapid application commissioning across low-, mid-, and high-end unified NAS and SAN systems
 The company has demonstrated strong performance by achieving tangible results for customers. Specific examples include the following:</p>
  </li>
  <li>Helped IP QL achieve 85% service subscription renewals from cloud customers</li>
  <li>Helped Teva Czech Industries manage production of six billion pills a year</li>
  <li>Helped RFA remove 100% of performance issues for transaction processing</li>
  <li>Helped Invesco reduce server and storage infrastructure ten-fold over two years</li>
  <li>Helped Photobucket successfully migrate 17 billion videos and photos
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its performance. It is one of the largest manufacturers of data storage systems. It has many prominent clients, including Citicorp Securities, Merrill Lynch, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Texas Instruments, and Yahoo! Lastly, it has won many honors, including a “Best of Show” award for Customer Innovation by IT Brand Pulse (2015) a TechTarget Quality Award for Technical Support (2015), selection as a 5-Star Storage Vendor by CRN (2015), and placement for 13 consecutive years on *Fortune *magazine’s “100 Best Companies” list.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>NetApp’s main channels are its direct sales team and channel partners. Channel partners include value-added resellers, original equipment manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, service providers, and technology partners. In its most recent fiscal year sales through channel partners represented 77% of revenues. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, summits, and conferences.</p>

<p>Personalized Services – NetApp provides a NetApp Support Account Manager (SAM) who works directly with a client’s staff to gain a deep knowledge of their NetApp data storage environment</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is also a self-service component. The company’s website features a “Library” section that includes analyst reports, data sheets, technical reports, white papers, and “how-to” videos. There is also a community element in the form of a forum for peer interaction.</p>

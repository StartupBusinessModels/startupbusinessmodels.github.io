<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Ross Stores provides apparel products and accessories for the general consumer market, serving customers across multiple demographics. According to a recent investor presentation published by the Company, Ross Stores’s target customers are predominantly female, around 75% to 80%, who appreciate good quality brands, but also enjoy shopping for bargains.</p>

<p>Through its retail chains, Ross Stores serves a large domestic customer base across the US. This includes the operation of physical retail outlets across 36 US states, with a significant presence in California, Florida, and Texas. The Company does not appear to have any significant international operations.</p>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Chevron provides crude oil, petrochemical products and natural gas products to a range of customers worldwide. The Company primarily serves industrial clients across the following sectors:</p>

  <li>Utilities, such as Edison International, Spark Energy, and Portland General Electric.
 Chevron also serves major conglomerates such as General Electric and 3M, and directly serves consumers through its international network of petrol stations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chevron’s most significant market is its native US, which accounts for more than 40% of the Company’s total sales. The Company, however, operates globally, serving customers across the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Chevron provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its industry standing and reputation, with the Company being one of the largest and most recognisable brands in its industry, having a name associated with quality;</li>
  <li>Its track record for successful delivery, with the Company having successfully completed numerous projects across multiple jurisdictions;</li>
  <li>Its global operations and reach, with the Company operating exploration and production projects across the Americas, Asia Pacifica, Europe, and Africa, as well as operating similarly widespread sales and marketing channels; and</li>
  <li>Its operational expertise and experience, with the Company employing highly-trained, specialist operational staff and employing experienced industry executives.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>Chevron operates a website at www.chevron.com, through which its provides information on its activities, ongoing projects and corporate organisation. While the Company’s core oil and gas activities do not allow for the operation of an online sales channel, the Company does operate a webstore through which it sells branded merchandise.</p>

<p>Chevron’s sales are largely managed by the Company’s own in-house sales teams, which are organised geographically. These sales teams are focused principally on large commercial clients. In the US the Company markets petroleum products under the Chevron and Texaco brands, making sales both directly and through third-party retailers and</p>

<p>marketers across 7,860 Chevron and Texaco-branded service stations. Outside the US, Chevron sells petroleum products both directly and through third-parties across approximately 6,090 branded service stations.</p>

<p>Chevron also markets commercial aviation fuel at around 100 airports worldwide, and sells lubricant and coolant products under the names Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa, Rando, Clarity and Taro.

Chevron seeks to establish long-term relationships, with contracts generally spanning multiple years.</p>

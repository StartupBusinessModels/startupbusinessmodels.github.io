<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

It identifies multidisciplinary teams (featuring product experts, engineers, designers, business developers, etc.) and connects them so they can collaborate on a wide variety of projects. Specifically, they develop unconventional concepts with the goal of opening up new markets for SAP’s products; examples include smart traffic solutions and customized cancer therapy.</p>

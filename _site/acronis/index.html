    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-acronis">Businessmodel of Acronis</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Acronis has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at consumers and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Acronis offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, cost reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It offers solutions for data in remote, local, mobile, and cloud devices. Also, its products have been certified to work with Ubuntu Software, Red Hat Software, Mandriva Linux, and SuSE Certified Linux Software. It has been able to expand its capabilities due to numerous acquisitions. Its purchases include BackupAgent, nScaled, and GroupLogic. These acquisitions have enabled it to greatly expand its portfolio.</p>

<p>The company reduces costs in a variety of ways. It regularly provides special offers, such as “buy one license, get one free” and “protect five computers for the price of three.” It also offers free trials.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It protects the data of over 500,000 businesses in various industries and over 5.5 million consumers in more than 145 countries. It employs over 900 people. Lastly, it has won over 45 awards. Its many honors include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recognition as a Gold Winner in the the Server Backup Software category by Top 10 Reviews</li>
  <li>Recognition as one of CRN Magazine‘s 25 Coolest Mobile Software &amp; Service Vendors</li>
  <li>The Channel Pro Reader’s Choice Award for Best Backup and Disaster Recovery</li>

<p>Acronis’ main channel is its direct sales team. It also sells its products through a network of distributors, resellers, and service providers. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, sponsorships, and participation in conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Acronis’ customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website features a “Resources” section with useful tools such as articles, white papers, data sheets, case studies, solution briefs, executive summaries, evaluation guides, infographics, and videos. The site also provides analyst reports and product documentation.</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a personal assistance component in the form of 24/7 phone, e-mail, and live chat assistance. There is also a community element in the form of a peer forum.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Beyond these partners, Acronis also maintains technology alliances with ConnectWise, cPanel, Kaseya, LabTech, Microsoft, Odin, VMware, and Virtuozzo.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>It maintains important physical resources in the form of research and development centers in the United States, Russia, and Singapore, and cloud data centers in the U.S., Germany, France, Russia, Japan, and Singapore. It places a high priority on intellectual property, with over 100 patents. Lastly, it has relied on funding from outside parties, raising $11 million from three investors as of January 2004.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Acronis has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and administration, both fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Puppet has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at organizations of all industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Puppet offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, cost reduction, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It maintains a broad range of capabilities, including orchestration, automated provisioning, configuration automation, visualization &amp; reporting, code management, node management, and role-based access control.</p>

<p>The company reduces costs by enabling potential customers to try out its Puppet Enterprise product for free on up to 10 nodes. This enables them to assess whether they want to purchase it.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Specific positive outcomes for clients include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The New York Stock Exchange used Puppet’s solutions to scale up infrastructure and workloads efficiently, resulting in an increase from 300 servers per admin to 700 servers per admin</li>
  <li>LV used Puppet’s solutions to carry out its operations more quickly, resulting in faster shipping with fewer failures and its first month without any high-priority “Tier“ incidents</li>
  <li>Infusionsoft used Puppet’s solutions to automate and provide greater visibility into its infrastructure, resulting in its Ops team being able to manage double its prior number of servers</li>
  <li>Ambit Energy used Puppet’s solutions to automate everything from application deployment to infrastructure management, resulting in an increase in managed servers from 30 to 500</li>
  <li>Staples used Puppet’s solutions to automate its cloud management and common IT operations, resulting in a reduction in deployment cycle time from weeks to hours
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has over 500 employees operating out of five offices. It is used by over 35,000 companies, including over 75% of the *Fortune *100. Specific prominent clients include Verizon, Intel, Sony, ADP, REI, NASA, and Salesforce.</li>
</ul>

<p>It hosts an annual conference called PuppetConf, billed as a DevOps, automation, and infrastructure modernization event that features exhibits and educational sessions and facilitates networking.</p>

</ul>

<p>It also features a “Knowledge Base“ that provides answers to common questions and provides access to a monthly newletter. There is also a community element in the form of a forum and Puppet User Groups, which enable customers to meet up in person.</p>

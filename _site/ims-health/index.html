<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>IMS Health provides information and technology services to organisations operating within the healthcare sector. Its customer base comprises a broad range of companies within the sector, with around 90% of its sales coming from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>life science companies;</li>
  <li>pharmaceutical groups;</li>
  <li>biotechnology firms;</li>
  <li>consumer health providers;</li>
  <li>medical device manufacturers;</li>
  <li>diagnostic companies;
 According to the Company’s annual report, it includes almost all of the top 100 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, measured by revenue, among its clients, many of which subscribe to products and services across multiple jurisdictions. IMS Health also serves medical product distributors, government and regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical distributors, financial services firms, and pharmacies. Sales to government agencies represent only around 1% of the Company’s business.</li>
</ul>

<p>IMS Health’s largest market is its native US, which accounted for around 39% of the Company’s 2015 revenue. The Company, however, also serves customers across more than 100 countries worldwide, with business in emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia growing significantly in recent years.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>IMS Health provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its industry standing and brand identity, being one of the largest companies in its sector and having a number of longstanding client relationships with high-profile customers;</li>
  <li>The quality and efficiency of its products and services, comprising a diverse suite of solutions developed by in-house experts with the support of market-leading technology partners;</li>
  <li>Its flexible and scalable products and solutions, which can be implemented across businesses of all sizes and in various jurisdictions; and</li>

According to its annual report, the average length of relationships with its top 25 clients, as measured by revenue, is over 25 years and its retention rate for its top 1,000 clients from 2014 to 2015 was 99%.</p>

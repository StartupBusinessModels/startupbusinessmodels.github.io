<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Both Lexmark International’s laser printing and imaging products and enterprise software solutions are targeted primarily at business customers. The Company serves business across multiple sectors, including the healthcare, financial services and insurance industries. A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is also derived from contracts with the US federal, state and local governments, as well as international governments and agencies.</p>

<p>Lexmark International’s native US remains its largest single market; however, the majority of the Company’s sales come from its international customers. Around 35% of the Company’s international sales come from within Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Lexmark International also sells products and services across North and South America, Asia, the Pacific Rim and the Caribbean.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

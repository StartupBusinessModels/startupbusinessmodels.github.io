<p>Praxair owns or licenses a large number of United States and foreign patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes. Searches of records published by the US Patent and Trademark Office identified a number of patent applications filed in Praxair’s name, including applications entitled ‘Gas compressor control system preventing vibration damage’, ‘High purity zirconia-based thermally sprayed coatings and processes for the preparation thereof’ and ‘Air compression system and method’.</p>

<p>Praxair also owns and or leases a number of physical properties that are key to its activities, notably its production and processing facilities across the US, Brazil, Mexico, China, and India.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Praxair incurs costs in relation to the development of its technologies and intellectual properties, the procurement of materials and supplies, the operation of its industrial gas production facilities, the operation of its sales and distribution infrastructure, the implementation of marketing and advertising campaigns, the management of its partnerships, and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<p>In 2015 Praxair recorded cost of sales in the amount of $5.96 billion.

The Company also generates a portion of its revenue from the sale of various resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders.</p>

<p>In 2015 Praxair generated annual sales of $10.78 billion, down slightly on the $12.27 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. The Company attributed this decrease of around 12% to negative currency translation impacts. The majority of Praxair’s sales for the year were attributed to its North America segment, which alone recorded sales for the year of $5.87. The remaining sales were dispersed relatively evenly across the Company’s other geographic segments, with the Surface Technologies segment recording $609 million.</p>

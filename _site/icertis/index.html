<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Icertis has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Icertis offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its platform works seamlessly with Microsoft Office and integrates easily with all major CRM, ERP, PLM, CPQ, Sourcing Procurement, Service Management, Project Management, and Document Management solutions.</p>

<p>It can also be implemented across different markets and geographies thanks to multilingual support. Lastly, its solution can manage any type of contract – including sell-side, buy-side,  corporate, MSA, NDA, SOW, MoUs, and employment.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for clients. It features a configurable dashboard that adapts to the role of the user and provides only the metrics and data that that person needs. New workflows, fields, and rules can be configured without custom development. Lastly, its “smart search” feature saves key data specific to the user’s contracts.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific positive outcomes for clients include the following:</p>

<ul>

 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It bills itself as the leading provider of contract lifecycle management in the cloud. Its ICM solution manages over 2.5 million contracts by more than 750,000 users in over 90 countries and over 40 languages.

<p>That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

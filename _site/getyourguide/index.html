    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-getyourguide">Businessmodel of GetYourGuide</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>GetYourGuide’s platform is primarily designed to provide access to a full-range of available activities, excursions and services in a given destination for tourists and travellers. This covers a broad selection of activities, ranging from walking tours, cooking classes and transit services to winter sports, bar crawls and extreme sports.</p>

<p>GetYourGuide also targets third-party service providers and activity organisers that wish to expand their reach and visibility with a view to increasing their rate of sales. These comprise smaller, local companies that do not already have an international audience.</p>

<p>Thirdly, GetYourGuide allows established travel agencies and companies to generate revenue through provision of affiliate marketing services.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>For its end-users GetYourGuide’s greatest value is that it enables travellers to book a range of activities and services from a single platform, before arriving at a destination. The Company’s various partnerships also enable users to access deals and offers that may otherwise not have been available.</p>

<p>The GetYourGuide platform is attractive to third-party suppliers as it enables them to advertise their products and services to a larger audience with no registration or listing cost. It also offers value to established affiliate partners which can generate revenue through marketing and integration.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>GetYourGuide can be accessed via its desktop and mobile websites at www.getyourguide.com, as well as through its iOS and Google Play apps.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>For customers GetYourGuide is a self-service platform. Users are able to make bookings with all available suppliers and in all available locations directly through www.getyourguide.com, with no interference from the Company itself.</p>

<p>The Company’s multilingual sales teams can be contacted via email and telephone, with separate phone numbers for customers in the UK, the US, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland and Germany and an international number for all other users.</p>

<p>GetYourGuide’s relationships with suppliers and affiliates are more personalised. Each of its third-party suppliers receives assistance from a personal account manager. Affiliate partners also receive a bespoke service that requires direct interaction with the GetYourGuide sales and marketing team.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>GetYourGuide develops and maintains an online platform through which tourists are able to book tours, activities, classes and events in multiple destinations worldwide.</p>

<p>It also manages partnerships with affiliate sellers and suppliers enabling operators to reach a larger audience with their offers and for travel agencies to generate revenue through commissions.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>GetYourGuide maintains an affiliate partner network that comprises numerous travel agents, resellers, and leisure companies, through which GetYourGuide products are marketed. This includes high-profile companies such as Opodo, Lufthansa Holidays, Tui and STA Travel. The Company has a three-tiered partnership system.</p>

<p>Basic general affiliates receive a variety of tools and advertising materials, as well as access to the activity-tracking platform, while advanced partners, with which the Company has an established relationship, receiving greater commissions and access to the GetYourGuide API integrations tools. A third tier is reserved for selected partners that require more tailored solutions. Once a company is admitted to the partner program they are eligible for a 6% base commission rate. Travel agents immediately receive a 10% rate, but are not given access to the integration tools made available to other partners.</p>

<p>GetYourGuide also partners with numerous professional suppliers of local tourist services across a number of countries worldwide. This includes tour operators, local attractions, transport and activities providers, and sports and events organisers, which provide the Company’s catalogue of products and services. These partners are afforded access to translation, analytics and payment services tools provided by GetYourGuide.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>GetYourGuide’s key resources are its technology infrastructure, including the platform itself and its servers, and its network of suppliers, without which the Company would have no products to sell.</p>

<p>Its personnel is also a key resource, in particular its sales and marketing teams, which manage the Company’s partnerships, and its engineering teams, which maintain and develop the Company’s proprietary software.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>GetYourGuide incurs significant costs as an employer of a large and multilingual workforce, including several regional sales and marketing teams.</p>

<p>This regional structure also leads to costs in operating several international offices, all of which accrue rental and utility costs.</p>

<p>GetYourGuide is also obliged to pay commissions on sales to its affiliate marketing partners.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>It is free for suppliers to list their products and services on the GetYourGuide platform, however a commission is charged for every booking that is accepted by these suppliers. The size of this commission is agreed directly and on an individual basis between GetYourGuide and the supplier.</p>

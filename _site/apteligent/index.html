<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Apteligent serves a range of companies that wish to gain greater insight into the performance of their mobile apps. On its website the Company claims to provide services covering 23,000 apps worldwide.</p>

<p>This includes customers operating in the retail, entertainment, gaming, media, finance, telecommunications, hospitality and technology sectors. While many of the Company’s customers are based primarily in the US, Apteligent also has customers in France, Denmark, Canada, Finland and the UK. The Company includes a number of household names among its customers, such as Bloomberg, AT&amp;T, Bank of America, Ebay, Microsoft, Nokia and Marriott.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Apteligent’s principal value is in its software platform, which purports to improve the efficiency, reliability and profitability of its customers’ applications.</p>

<p>The Company’s software provides accurate, real-time insights that can be used to monitor and identify issues before they are realised. Apteligent offers a range of subscriptions, including fully negotiable enterprise packages for its biggest clients.</p>

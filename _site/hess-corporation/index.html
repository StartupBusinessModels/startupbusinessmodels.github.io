<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Hess provides a range of products and services to commercial customers operating primarily in the oil and gas sector. The Company’s two operating segments serve different customers segments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exploration and Production, which sells crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids to companies operating across the automotive, aviation, chemicals processing, refining, and fuel and lubricants markets, among others;</li>

</ul>

<p>Hess principally provides products and services to customers in its domestic market of the US. The Company also serves clients across three other geographic categories: Africa, Europe, and Asia and Other Countries.</p>

<p>Hess operates an in-house direct sales force, which is organised by geographic region and operating department.

<p>Hess has production operations located in the US, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand, Malaysia and Norway, and serves an international customer base.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Hess’s key resources are its materials and supply chains, its operating and exploration licenses and permits, its exploration and production equipment and infrastructure, its midstream and distribution infrastructure, its sales channels, its partnerships, and its personnel.</p>

<p>Hess owns and or leases a range of physical properties and facilities around the world that are key to its ongoing activities. This notably includes its production and exploration assets, as well as its network of offices, its pipeline network, its processing and refining facilities, its storage and distribution centres, its terminaling infrastructure, and its rail loading facilities.</p>

<p>Despite its use of technology and state-of-the-art equipment, searches of records published by the US Patent and Trademark Office identified no patent applications filed in Hess’s name.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Hess incurs costs in relation to the procurement of materials and equipment – including the purchase of crude oil, the operation of its exploration and production assets, the operation of it midstream and distribution infrastructure, the operation of its sales channels, the management of its partnerships, and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<p>In 2015 Hess recorded cost of products sold in the amount of $1.29 billion and total operating costs and expenses in the amount of $2.03 billion. The Company also accrued exploration costs totalling $881 million and general and administrative costs in the amount of $557 million.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Hess generates revenue through the operation of oil and gas exploration and production assets, as well as midstream and distribution services. The Company’s revenue can be divided into two principal streams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sales revenue derived from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids; and</li>
  <li>Service revenue derived from long-term, fee-based service agreements for its midstream services.
 In 2015 Hess generated annual revenue of $6.64 billion, down on the $10.74 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. The Company attributed this to reduced drilling activity and divestment of certain assets. The majority of the Company’s revenue, around $5.90 billion, was generated through the sale of Crude oil and natural gas liquids, with natural gas sales accounting for just $1.05 billion.</li>
</ul>

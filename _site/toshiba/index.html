<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>For general consumers Toshiba’s products are available on a self-service basis, with customers able to purchase Toshiba branded products through online channels and retail outlets with no interaction with Toshiba sales representatives.</p>

<p>Customers of Toshiba’s more specialised industrial, medical and business products and services require a greater degree of personal attention, making purchases directly through the Company’s sales team and receiving a service tailored to their individual needs.</p>

<p>Toshiba provides technical assistance to its consumer, business and industrial customers through online guides, tutorials and direct personal assistance, and interacts with customers through its YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Toshiba manufactures, markets, and sells electrical and electronic products. This includes consumer-focused computer hardware products and home appliances, such as laptops, hard drives, televisions, washing machines and refrigerators; industrial products such as semiconductors, motors, and transformers; and medical imaging equipment for healthcare facilities.</p>

<p>Toshiba manufactures its own products via a network of manufacturing facilities in the US, Canada, Japan, Vietnam, Brazil and China.</p>

<p>The Company then sells products directly to customers via its online store and sales team, as well as indirectly through a global network of third-party retailers, distributors and authorised resellers. The Company also provides technical and business services, including cloud and client management solutions.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>Toshiba manages a partner program named the Toshiba Commerce Alliance. This program divides the company’s partners into software partners, comprising independent software vendors who own applications deployed on the Toshiba product portfolio; innovation partners, for companies who have original equipment manufacturer solutions enabled on one or more Toshiba products; and authorised service partners who have signed a subcontractor agreement and are authorize to offer warranty services and maintenance to Toshiba customers.</p>

<p>Partners are also categorised into Business Partner, Gold Business Partner and Diamond Business Partner levels, dependent on performance and contribution to Toshiba revenue. Among Toshiba’s partners are Mekano, RetailPro, and Siatec Systems as software partners; IBM, Microsoft, Cognizant and Verifone as innovation partners; and Informatica, Dacoll and Warpol as authorised service partners.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Toshiba’s key resources are its products and technology, its manufacturing facilities, its sales and distribution networks – including warehousing and logistics facilities, and its personnel.</p>

<p>The Company was reported to employ more than 215,000 workers worldwide in 2015 but plans to reduce this number to around 180,000 by March 2017, as part of a structural reform triggered by an accounting scandal. A workforce this large generates significant costs in terms of salaries and benefits.</p>

<p>The Company also operates a broad network of offices and facilities across the world, which accrue costs in the form of utilities and rent.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Toshiba generates revenue through the manufacture and sale of electric and electronic products. The Company’s revenue is divided into five principal segments: Energy and Infrastructure, Community Solutions, Healthcare Systems and Devices, Electronic Devices and Components, and Lifestyle Products and Services.</p>

<p>In 2015 Toshiba’s Energy and Infrastructure segment – including the manufacture and sale of industrial products such as generators, power systems and energy storage systems – accounted for 28% of total sales, the Company’s largest single segment.</p>

<p>Electronic Devices and Components accounted for 24%, Community Solutions accounted for 19%, Lifestyle Products accounted for 16% and Healthcare Systems and Services accounted for 6%. The remaining 7% was attributed to other products and services that do not fit into one of the Company’s product segments, such as cloud and network solutions.</p>

<p>In 2015 Toshiba generated JPY 6.7 trillion (approximately $60.3 billion) in annual revenue.</p>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Atos offers two primary value propositions: performance and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results for customers. High-profile examples of these outcomes include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BP used Atos’ services to reduce the overall cost of application management by 7% year-over-year while consistently meeting service targets</li>
  <li>AT&amp;S used Atos’ application management services to change the structure of its Russian delivery center, saving approximately 30% in costs per project</li>
  <li>Cineworld used Atos’ services to make enhancements to its subscription program, enabling it to reduce operational costs and attract thousands of new customers per month</li>
  <li>EDF Energy used Atos to replace its Data Processing System, enabling it to introduce the new ADACS solution that improved performance and is expected to operate for 20+ years
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It generated revenues of €10.7 billion in 2015 and has over 100,000 employees operating in 72 countries. Its Worldline division is the leader of the payments and transactional services sector in Europe. Its clients include 42% of the Global 500 and 20% of the U.S.* Fortune *500. Lastly, it has won many honors, including a leading position in the Experton Group/West Trax service provider Vendor Benchmark, ranking as a Top 10 Outsourcing Service Provider by ISG, and recognition as a “Leader” in the Gartner Magic Quadrants for Data Center Outsourcing and Infrastructure Utility Services in Europe (all in 2015).</li>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Atos has a value-driven structure, aiming to provide a premium proposition through significant personal service and frequent service improvements.</p>

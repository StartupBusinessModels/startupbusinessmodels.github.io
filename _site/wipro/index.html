    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-wipro">Businessmodel of Wipro</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Wipro has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customers. The company targets its offerings at organizations of all sizes in all industries. That said, many of its customers fall into the education, financial services, manufacturing, and telecommunications sectors.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Wipro offers three primary value propositions: innovation, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company has placed an emphasis on innovation throughout its history. It entered the fledgling information technology industry early, in 1981. It was a pioneer in the marketing of indigenous PCs in 1985. Lastly, it was one of the earliest firms to develop the Offshore Development Center concept.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance for its clients. One high-profile case example involves a leading heavy equipment manufacturer. Wipro’s IT services helped it as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduced service operations expenses by 10-15%</li>
  <li>Increased end-owner loyalty and retention by 10-12%</li>
  <li>Achieved 15% savings in service revenues and 5% improvement in margin</li>
  <li>Reduced down time with increased machine activity</li>
  <li>Enabled optimal inventory storage
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It has more than 170,000 employees serving customers in over 175 cities in six continents. It has a market capitalization of $21 billion and generated $7.7 billion in revenues in its most recent fiscal year. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the Global Growth Alliances Partner Award by EMC (2015), a Best Outsourcing Thought Leadership Award by The Outsourcing Institute (2015), and placement on the Top 26 Most Innovative Companies list by the Confederation of Indian Industry (2014).</li>

Furthermore, it maintains two manufacturing sites in India. Lastly, it places a high priority on intellectual property, with 184 registered and 900 pending patents.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

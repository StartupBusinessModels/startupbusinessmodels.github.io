    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-nutanix">Businessmodel of Nutanix</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Nutanix has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at organizations of all industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Nutanix offers four primary value propositions: convenience, innovation, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life easier for clients. It simplifies datacenter infrastructure by integrating storage and server resources into a turnkey appliance that can be deployed in just 30 - 60 minutes. It also scales storage quickly, going from three servers to thousands.</p>

<p>The company has embraced innovation as a part of its culture. Its Enterprise Cloud Platform leverages hyperconvergence and Intel x86-based servers to natively integrate storage, compute, and virtualization in scale-out clusters. It replaces the need for separate management processes.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. It claims to have an 8x faster time-to-value in buying, implementing, and managing than any other hyperconvergence solution. Also, research firm IDC projected in 2015 that on average, <em>organizations’ use of IT solutions powered by Nutanix software would yield five-year discounted benefits worth $7.85 million, a return on investment of 510%, a payback period of 7.5 months, and a reduction in their total cost of ownership by 58.3% over five years. Specific examples of positive outcomes for clients include:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Insurance firm ADD used Nutanix’s solutions to speed up the installation of a virtual desktop infrastructure, reducing the time taken from three months to 14 days</li>
  <li>Agilis Networks used Nutanix’s solutions to implement a new storage solution, resulting in savings of $12,000 in power and electricity costs over 3 years</li>
  <li>Akron Public Schools used Nutanix’s solutios to replace its infrastructure, resulting in savings of over 20 hours of compute time per week</li>
  <li>ASL Airlines France used Nutanix’s solutions to install new infrastructure, resulting in a reduction in the time taken for computer systems to connect to sessions, from three minutes to 20 seconds
 The company reduces costs by offering flexibility. It operates the Nutanix GSOFlex Services Credit program, which enables clients to earn credits when they purchase its products. These credits can be used to purchase consulting, training, and other services in the future. The program includes packaged services that provide built-in volume discounts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. IDC indicates that it <em>generated 52% of all hyperconverged revenue worldwide during the first half of 2014. It has a Net Promoter Score of 92 and a 9.6 Customer Satisfaction Rating, one of the highest customer satisfaction scores in the hyperconvergence industry. It has over 4,400 customers in over 90 countries. It claims its clients include the #1 companies in the drug, home retail, media, medical, auto, beverage, and electronics industries.

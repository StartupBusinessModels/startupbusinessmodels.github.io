<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>TIBCO offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired dozens of software and technology firms since its founding. In the past five years alone, it has purchased Nimbus, LogLogic, Maporama Solutions, Streambase Systems, Extended Results, Jaspersoft, and Mashery. This strategy has enabled it to greatly diversify its portfolio and expand its capabilities.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Examples of positive outcomes for specific customers include the following:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. TIBCO’s website features a Customer Support Portal with helpful resources such as product documentation and answers to frequently asked questions.

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>United Rentals has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commercial Construction Companies – Companies that use equipment for constructing and renovating commercial buildings, warehouses, industrial and manufacturing plants, office parks, airports, residential developments, and other facilities.</li>
  <li>Industrial Companies – Manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders and utilities that use equipment for plant maintenance, upgrades, expansion, and construction.</li>
  <li>Residential Customers – Homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.
 ### Value Proposition</li>
</ul>

<p>United Rentals offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, cost reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It offers over 3,300 classes of rental equipment, which includes general industrial and construction equipment, trench safety equipment, aerial work platforms, power and HVAC equipment, pumps, and general tools and light equipment. The products can be rented on a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis. The company also provides a broad set of related services, ranging from online management tools to custom onsite specialty solutions.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for its customers. Its clients can order equipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week through its website. They can also use its UR Control application to manage the rental process and view real-time reports on business activity. Lastly, they can use Total Control, a proprietary software application that allows them to manage and monitor all of their equipment needs. It can be integrated into their enterprise resource planning systems.</p>

<p>The company reduces costs by saving customers up to 35% on annual rental costs on average, thanks to its advanced fleet management system.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It bills itself as the largest equipment rental company in the world, with a store network nearly three times the size of any other provider. It has a network of 890 rental locations in 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces.

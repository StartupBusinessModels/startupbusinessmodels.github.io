<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

The Company has a devoted sales team that manages the process of bidding for and securing government contracts, which requires that the Company be compliant with a series of official regulations.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>ManTech International’s key resources are its technology and cybersecurity solutions, its intellectual properties, its IT infrastructure, and its personnel – notably its security and technology specialist staff.</p>

<p>The Company owns a limited number of patents, and maintains a number of trademarks and service marks to identify and distinguish its goods and services. While the Company takes steps to protect its patents and marks, it does not consider its business to depend protection of its intellectual property.

<p>The Company accrues substantial general and administrative costs, paying the salaries and benefits of its 7,200 employees, and rent and utility fees in relation to its network of facilities, including offices, laboratories and warehouses.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>ManTech International generates revenue through the provision of various cyber security and technology solutions, including security and intelligence, big data, supply chain management, and test and evaluation services. The Company’s revenue is generated through fees associated with the following contracts forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cost-reimbursable contracts</li>
  <li>Fixed-price contracts</li>
  <li>Time and materials contracts
 In 2015 ManTech International generated an annual revenue of $1.55 billion, down on the $1.77 billion recorded in 2014. The majority of the Company’s revenue, around 90.7%, was derived from contracts with US government agencies focused on national security. Around 20.7% was derived from contracts with federal civilian agencies, and approximately 1.1% was derived from contracts with state agencies, international agencies and commercial entities.</li>
</ul>

<p>ManTech International’s dependence on government contracts means that its operational results are affected by US government spending levels in the areas of defense, federal health information technology, intelligence and homeland security.</p>

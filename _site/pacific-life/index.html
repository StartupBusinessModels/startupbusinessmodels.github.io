<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Pacific Life has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at individuals, businesses, and pension plans.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Pacific Life offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its products/services include the following:  life insurance, annuities, mutual funds, investment products/services for businesses, financial protection, wealth accumulation, and wealth preservation.</p>

<p>The company’s structure helps foster innovation. It maintains a mutual holding company structure, meaning that contract and policy owners are members of the company and it is not influenced by stock price when making decisions. This frees up the firm to develop innovative products.</p>

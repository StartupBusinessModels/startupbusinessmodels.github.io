<p>Walmart’s Sam’s Club arm, in addition to serving individual customers, also serves small and medium-sized business, accommodating bulk orders of merchandise at wholesale process, enabling customers to sell products on at a small profit.</p>

<p>Walmart’s largest market is its native US, which accounts for the largest portion of the Company’s annual sales. The Company also serves a broad international network of customers, including in Africa, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Walmart provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>

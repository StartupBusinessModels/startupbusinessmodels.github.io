<p>The level of detail that Oracle puts into ensuring stellar and personalized communication that ensures issues are solved promptly results in a very low abandonment rate.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Oracle’s key activities have always centered around innovation and results. As part of a constantly evolving industry such as technology, the developers at Oracle are always focusing on upgrading their existing software solutions to meet the needs of the businesses they work with.

<p>A key resource for Oracle is their diverse and global workforce of over 130,000 employees.

<p>The sales costs arise from employing a dedicated sales team to generate leads for the company. There are also the costs of advertising their application suites to consider.</p>

<p>R&amp;D is another significant expenditure. As a technology company priding itself on innovation, a significant chunk of the company’s annual budget is reserved for R&amp;D expenses to help inspire new ways to make its software more efficient.</p>

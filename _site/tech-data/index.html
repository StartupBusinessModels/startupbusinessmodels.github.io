<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Tech Data has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company distributes products to value-added resellers, retailers, direct marketers, and corporate resellers.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Tech Data offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. Over the last 20 years, it has acquired over 18 firms, including ParityPlus, Softmart International, 2000 AG, Azlan Group, Scribona, and Signature Technology Group. These additions have enabled it to add several new capabilities to its portfolio, increasing offerings for clients.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life easier for clients. It provides fully-integrated supply chain support for various channels. It also provides technical support directly to clients’ customers so clients can save time and money. Lastly, it maintains a full-cycle, in-house marketing team that can handle promotional needs for clients, ranging from website design to outbound marketing.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is one of the largest wholesale distributors of technology products, solutions, and services in the world, generating $26.4 billion in 2015. It serves over 105,000 resellers in over 100 countries, and distributes products from over 1,200 tech vendors, including prominent firms such as Apple, HP, Cisco, and Microsoft. It completes 50,000 transactions daily and has sold over 150,000 IT products. Lastly, it has won many honors, including recognition as one of the world’s top cloud service providers by Talkin‘ Cloud for two years in a row and as one of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” by *Fortune *for seven years in a row.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Tech Data’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company provides training and certification services to its reseller customers in order to help them configure, install, finance, and sell products.

The company also maintains a “Solutions Center” at its Clearwater, FL campus. The 6,000-square foot facility is a proof-of-concept lab where resellers can explore a wide range of IT solutions and receive product training.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>EMCOR generates revenue through its provision of various engineering, construction and industrial services to a broad range of customers. This principally includes revenue derived from contracts relating to small and large contracts across it five operating segments.</p>

<p>In 2015 EMCOR generated annual revenue of $6.72 billion, up slightly on the $6.42 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. This small increase was attributed to general growth across the Company’s segments.

<ul>
  <li>Retailers, including specialist food retailers, drug stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, and supermarket chains;</li>
  <li>Convenience Retail, including vending machine operators, convenience kiosks, mobile retail units, and other alternate retailing outlets</li>
  <li>Distributors and Wholesalers, including food wholesalers, consumer foods distributors, and other specialist distributors;</li>
  <li>Foodservice Customers, including cafes, coffee houses, and other foodservice outlets; and</li>
  <li>General Consumers, including general consumers across multiple demographics.
 In 2015 Kellogg’s top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 34% of the Company’s consolidated net sales and approximately 47% of US net sales. The Company’s largest customer was Walmart, which accounted for around 21% of consolidated net sales during 2015. The Company also serves large retail chains such as Target.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kellogg serves a global customer base. Its largest single market remains the US, however, the Company also serves a network of customers across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, and parts of Africa.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Kellogg provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its industry standing and reputation, with the Company established as one of the largest manufacturers of consumer food products in the world, serving a number of high-profile retail clients, and having a reputation for offering high-quality products;</li>
  <li>Its extensive brand portfolio, with the Company controlling a range of popular, well-known brands across multiple product categories, including Pringles, Coco Pops, Pop Tarts, and Rice Krispies;</li>
  <li>Its global reach, with the Company offering its diverse product range to customers across its home market of the US, as well as more broadly across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa;</li>
  <li>Its diverse sales channels, with the Company reaching consumers with its products through various retail channels, including major supermarkets chains, vending machine operators, and certain food service businesses; and</li>
  <li>Its broad infrastructure network, with the Company operating an extensive network of manufacturing and distribution facilities around the world, enabling it to serve its customers quickly and efficiently, regardless of their geographic location.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

The Company does not operate an online sales channel for its core products. It does, however, operate an online store at www.kelloggstore.com, through which it sells Kellogg-branded merchandise, such as apparel, homeware, and collectibles. It also operates an online customer portal and rewards program named Kellogg’s Family Rewards.</p>

<p>Kellogg principally sells its products through its own in-house direct sales force, which is organised by operating segment and geographic region.

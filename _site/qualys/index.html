    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-qualys">Businessmodel of Qualys</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Qualys has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at businesses and government entities of all sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Qualys offers four primary value propositions: convenience, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making its offerings easy to use. Its solution is cloud-based, meaning there is no software to implement or infrastructure to maintain. Furthermore, it can be scaled to the largest of businesses, from one to a million users. Clients can buy an entire suite or buy standalone applications. The platform provides a continuous view of a client’s compliance and security landscape, including all of their web applications and IP-connected devices. Lastly, it can be run from any web browser and can be run on-demand or automatically at preferred times.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. As a high-profile example, Bank of the West used Qualys’s solution to eliminate security risks and meet regulations, facilitating its growth from 102 branches to 300 and from one Internet access point to six.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk through high security and safety standards. It operates the Qualys Vulnerability Research Team, which maintains a list of “Top 10 Vulnerabilities” that aids security administrators in prioritizing the most serious threats. It also keeps a thorough tracking of threats.  In fact, an independent study found that Qualys collects the most comprehensive list of critical security vulnerabilities among threat management firms, nearly twice that of its closest competitor. These dangers are monitored on a continuous basis to manage them as they rise and evolve in real time. Lastly, the team creates 25 vulnerability signature updates per week on average, making the Qualys KnowledgeBase the biggest and most up-to-date vulnerability signature database.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It touts itself as the leading provider of compliance and information security cloud solutions. It is used by over 8,800 clients in more than 100 countries, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over 60% of the <em>Forbes</em> Global 50 and a majority of the <em>Fortune</em> 100</li>
  <li>9 of the top 10 firms in Technology, Retail, and Biotechnology</li>
  <li>7 of the top 10 firms in Chemical and Banking</li>
  <li>6 of the top 10 firms in Software, Telecom, Media, Car Manufacturing, and Food Retail
 Its prominent clients include Pfizer, ADP, Cisco, Oracle, Facebook, Microsoft, Comcast, Staples, Verizon, Toshiba, and Daimler.  Qualys‘s platform conducts over <em>three billion IP scans/audits a year,</em> resulting in more than one trillion security events. Lastly, the company has won many honors, including ranking as #1 in IDC’s Device Vulnerability Assessment revenue share report for six years in a row (2014), recognition as “Best Security Company“ by *SC *Magazine (2014), and high placements in Gartner’s Magic Quadrants for Web Application Security and Vulnerability Assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Qualys’s main channel is its direct sales team. Its field sales force focuses on selling to enterprises (typically firms with 5,000+ employees) and government agencies, while its inside sales force focuses on selling to small and mid-size firms. The company also conducts sales indirectly through its network of channel partners, who include value-added resellers, managed service providers, and consulting firms. These partners accounted for 37% of total revenues in 2015.</p>

<p>Qualys promotes its offering through its social media pages, online marketing, advertising, web-based seminar campaigns, free trials and services, and participation in conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Qualys’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company assists customers in the following ways:</p>

Training workshops are provided in-person and online. Participants who pass the certification exam are named Qualys Certified Specialists and receive a certificate of training.
 Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. The company’s website features a “Resources” section that includes product guides, product demos, data sheets, white papers, analyst reports, eBooks, and webcasts. The site also provides answers to frequently asked questions and a training library with how-to videos. Lastly, there is a community element in the form of a forum.</li>

<p>Its biggest cost driver is sales/marketing, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of research and development, a fixed expense, and cost of revenues, a variable expense that primarily consists of personnel expenses.</p>

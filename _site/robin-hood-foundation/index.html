<h3 id="donor-segments-customer-segments">Donor Segments (Customer Segments)</h3>

<p>RHF’s donation sources can be split into two groups: direct donations and revenue from activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct donations – Direct donations come from two types of donors – ad-hoc and pledge donors. Ad-hoc donors are persons who donate one-off sums toward RHF’s activities. Pledge donors are persons who promise to donate a certain amount of money over a certain period of time.</li>
  <li>Revenue from Activities – Revenue can also be raised through fund-raising activities – RHF holds activities such as galas and dinners, and collects revenues from the sales of tickets or of items and services at these activities.
 ### Value Proposition</li>
</ul>

<p>RHF’s value proposition to donors is the result-focused approach that it takes to philanthropy – donors are assured that their money goes to the most effective cause. This is because RHF evaluates potential non-profit partners and only selects the 200 most effective to receive assistance.</p>

<p>RHF also draws in top talent for its staff and its board – these persons are typically rich, accomplished, and/or famous and are able to leverage on their connections and experience to serve the organization.</p>

<h3 id="programme-delivery-methods-channels">Programme delivery methods (Channels)</h3>

<p>RHF delivers assistance through three channels – in-house programmes, financial assistance, and services.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-house programmes – RHF conducts a number of in-house programmes for specific purposes either inside or outside of its usual areas of focus. One example of the latter is the Hurricane Sandy Relief Fund, which makes grants to organisations that are assisting victims of the hurricane. One example of the former is the public/private partnership of RHF with the NYC Department of Education to set up school facilities (i.e. charter schools) to serve students from low-income families.</li>
  <li>Financial Assistance – The bulk of RHF’s resources go into financial grants to organisations that fall into its areas of focus (i.e. education, jobs and economic security, early childhood and youth, and survival). These grants normally come with performance conditions attached, and some grantees have members of RHF on their board of directors.</li>
  <li>Services – RHF also provides services to its grantees. These generally take the form of consulting services for various business functions. The functions covered are: legal, strategy, human capital, real estate, governance, and marketing.
 ### Customer Relationships</li>
</ul>

<p>RHF maintains relationships with its donors through major events such as galas and dinners, and through the connections of its staff and board.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>RHF’s key activities include the provision of financial assistance and services to third party non-profits, and the establishment of its own in-house programmes for certain targeted areas.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>Key partners include pro-bono service providers (e.g. Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP, which provides pro bono legal services), and both institutional and individual pledgers.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>RHF’s key resource is its personnel – its staff and board are typically wealthy, accomplished, and/or famous persons who can leverage on their personal wealth and connections for the good of the organization.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>The bulk of RHF’s resources are deployed in financial grants. Other key costs include wages and other staff costs, fundraising costs, and marketing.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>RHF’s main revenue streams are from ad-hoc or pledge donors, and from fundraising activities.</p>

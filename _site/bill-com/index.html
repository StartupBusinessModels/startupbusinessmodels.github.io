<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Bill.com has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs).</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Bill.com offers five primary value propositions: convenience, accessibility, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by simplifying operations. Its solution automates a wide range of payable and receivable processes, saving clients the time needed to search for missing documents, chase after approvers, sign checks, print and mail checks, and look up information for vendors.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. It acts as an add-on feature to accounting software packages (rather than as a standalone option), and it enables integration with most major providers, including QuickBooks, QuickBooks Online, NetSuite, Xero, and Intacct.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. It reduces the time spent for clients to receive, approve, and pay their bills online by 50%. When the clients’ customers pay their invoices online, the cash goes into clients’ bank accounts 2-3 times faster than previously.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk through high standards for financial data protection. Examples of its security practices include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Protections – The company’s servers are located in a high-security facility with biometric access controls and guard and video surveillance 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</li>
  <li>Network Protections – The company prevents unauthorized electronic access to servers through intrusion-detection devices and firewalls.</li>
  <li>Data Protections – The company protects data with the same encryption tools that banks use.</li>
  <li>Applicaiton Protections – The company utilizes multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent fraudulent access to clients‘ Bill.com accounts.</li>
  <li>Payments Protections – The company’s Positive Pay feature works at the bank level to assure that altered checks will not be paid.</li>
  <li>Process Protections – The company has a leading national accounting firm regularly conduct a SOC 1, Type 2 Audit.
 The company has established a powerful brand as a result of its success. It touts itself as the leading digital business payments firm offering A/P and A/R solutions. It helps more than 1,000,000 network members process more than $26 billion in payments each year. It has many prominent clients, including three of the top ten U.S. banks and 44% of the top 100 accounting firms. Lastly, Bill.com has won 44 major awards for technology innovation and leadership. These include recognition as one of the <em>San Francisco Business Times‘ *“Most Innovative Companies“, a *PC Magazine</em> Editor’s Choice Award, and placement on the CNBC Disruptor 50 and OnDemand Top 100 lists.</li>
</ul>

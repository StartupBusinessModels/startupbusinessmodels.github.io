<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Deutsche Bank provides a large portfolio of services designed to serve a broad spectrum of clients. The Company’s four core operating segments target different customer segments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Corporate Banking and Securities, which serves corporate clients and investors;</li>
  <li>Private and Business Clients, which serves large retail clients and high-net-worth individuals;</li>
  <li>Global Transaction Banking, which serves medium and large commercial businesses, public bodies, and financial institutions; and</li>
  <li>Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management, which serves high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices.
 Deutsche Bank’s principal market is its native Germany and Western Europe. The Company, however, serves clients globally, including customers across the following geographic segments: Eastern Europe, North America, Central and South America, Asia Pacific, and Africa.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Deutsche Bank provides value to its clients in the following ways:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Its international reach, with the Company serving customers across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia through an established office network; and</li>
  <li>Its track record as a reliable provider of banking and non-banking financial services, with the Company having been in operation for a number of years, with a name for providing efficient and reliable services.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>Deutsche Bank operates a website at www.db.com, through which it provides information on its various products and services, and its activities.

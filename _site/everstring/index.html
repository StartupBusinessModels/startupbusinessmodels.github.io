    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-everstring">Businessmodel of Everstring</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>EverString has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets firms of all industries and sizes that want to obtain higher quality sales and marketing leads.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>EverString offers three primary value propositions: convenience, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by simplifying its customers’ operations. It extracts predictive insights by curating over 20,000 data signals across 11 million accounts. These insights go beyond standard demographic and firmographic data by mapping signals such as marketing maturity and growth trajectory. This information enables marketers to create highly-defined groupings of accounts for marketing outreach within minutes. These segments can be used to drive activities ranging from promotional events to new product releases to market expansion.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. CRM software firm Cirruspath used its solution to prioritize incoming leads for its marketing and sales teams, resulting in a 30% increase in conversions, a 24% increase in opportunity, and a 130% increase in deal size.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its performance. It bills itself as the only account-based, full lifecycle predictive platform for B2B sales and marketing. It has a number of prominent customers, including Microsoft, Comcast Business, Zenefits, Shutterstock, mongoDB, and Apttus.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>EverString’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offering through its social media pages and participation in summits and conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>EverString’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature.</p>

<p>Customers utilize the service through the main platform while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website features a “Resources” section that includes self-help tools such as reports, case studies, eBooks, “cheatsheets”, visual slide decks, infographics, and videos.</p>

<p>That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>EverString’s business model entails maintaining and updating its software-as-a-service platform.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>EverString does not maintain any formal partnership programs. That said, it does form strategic alliances from time to time in order to expand its reach. High-profile examples of these include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In May 2016 EverString announced it was extending its partnership with Marketo, a marketing automation software provider. EverString integrated its Audience Platform directly into Marketo’s Ad Bridge product, and the solution would be available through Marketo LaunchPoint.</li>
  <li>In May 2016 EverString announced that its artificial intelligence-powered platform was now integrated with Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online.</li>
  <li>In January 2015 EverString announced a partnership with HG Data, a vendor of competitive intelligence for installed technologies. Through the alliance, HG Data’s resources would be combined with EverString’s solutions.
 ### Key Resources</li>
</ul>

<p>EverString’s main resource is its proprietary software platform.</p>

<p>It depends on its engineering employees to maintain and update the platform, its sales/marketing employees to promote it, and its customer service staff to provide support.</p>

<p>As a relatively new startup it has relied heavily on funding from investors, raising $78.7 million from eight investors as of October 2015.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>EverString has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and administration, both fixed expenses.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>EverString has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from the subscription fees it charges for access to its software-as-a-service platform. Sales staff must be contacted directly for pricing quotes.</p>

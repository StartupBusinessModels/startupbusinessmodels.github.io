The company targets its offering at any organization that wants data visualized, and its clients range from sole proprietors to global corporations. Its customers operate in a wide range of industries, including retail, media/entertainment, business services, financial services, manufacturing, energy and telecommunications, life sciences and healthcare, and education.</p>

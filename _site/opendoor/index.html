    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-opendoor">Businessmodel of Opendoor</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Opendoor has a multi-sided business model, with two interdependent customer segments that are both needed in order to operate: home sellers and home buyers.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Opendoor offers four primary value propositions: convenience, risk reduction, price, and performance.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for customers. It purchases homes from consumers looking to sell and then resells them by a closing date chosen by the consumer – anywhere from three to 60 days later (shorter than typical closing periods). This prevents homeowners from having to use a real estate agent or list their properties (that said, they are free to use an agent if they would prefer). Receiving a payment quote from the company only takes a few hours. For home-buyers, it offers convenience by providing listings of move-in-ready properties that can be filtered by various criteria, so that they do not have to engage in an extensive, months-long search. The buyers can view the house in an all-day open house and then buy it online.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality and safety standards. It offers the Opendoor Guarantee, through which it gives people who have purchased a home 30 days to sell it back to the company (at the original price minus sunk fees, repair costs, and transaction costs such as commissions). Opendoor has an independent, state-licensed third party conduct a 180-point inspection to ensure that the home is still of a high-enough quality for its next buyer. For new home-buyers, the firm offers a two-year extended home warranty for protection.</p>

<p>The company offers a pricing value proposition. The process of requesting an offer quote for home-sellers is completely free.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. It makes competitive offers on homes for sale – for example, an independent study of properties sold to Opendoor found that its valuations average over $2,600 more than third-party appraisals. Furthermore, it has sold homes for 3,427 owners and generated more than $1.5 million in realtor commissions.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Opendoor’s main channel is its website. The company promotes its offering through its social media pages and participation in conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Opendoor’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize the service through the main platform while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website provides answers to frequently asked questions. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of inspections, repairs, and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Opendoor’s business model entails maintaining a common platform between two parties:  home sellers and home buyers.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>Opendoor maintains the following types of partnerships:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Independent, state-licensed inspectors that examine homes up for sale</li>
  <li>Vendors that repair homes up for sale that are in need of fixing</li>
  <li>Real estate agents who are chosen by home sellers to represent them as part of the sales process; the company obtains the seller’s address and then sends the agents an offer</li>
  <li>Third parties that refer an unrepresented home seller to the company; leads that result in a sale earn the referring party 25% of the commission (75% of the purchase price)
 ### Key Resources</li>
</ul>

<p>Opendoor’s main resource is its proprietary software platform, which serves thousands of home buyers and home sellers.</p>

<p>It depends on human resources in the form of technology employees to maintain and update the platform and customer service employees to provide support.</p>

<p>As a relatively new startup it has relied heavily on funding from outside parties, raising $109.95 million from 45 investors as of October 2015.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Opendoor has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation and low-price value propositions. Its biggest cost driver is likely transaction expenses, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and customer support operations, both fixed expenses.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Opendoor has one revenue stream: revenues generated from the fees it charges as a percentage of purchase price for sales transactions. These fall into two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The company charges 6% for the overall Opendoor experience, which enables it take care of behind-the-scenes work in order to provide a seamless selling experience</li>
  <li>The company charges 0-6% for market risk, which varies depending on local market conditions; these include the typical risks of selling, such as waiting months to resell a home and managing the situation when contracts fall throughs due to a buyer’s problems with financing</li>
</ul>

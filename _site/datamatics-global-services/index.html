<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Datamatics has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Datamatics offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its services address several processes, including Enterprise Document Management, Enterprise Content Management, Collaboration and Portals, BIDW &amp; Analytics, Application Development, Support &amp; Testing, and Mobility. It has been able to diversify its capabilities partly due to its many acquisitions. In the last few years alone, it has acquired CIGNEX and a controlling stake in Vista Infosystems.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality and security standards. It is the first and only information technology firm to have won the “International Asia Pacific Award” for Quality in the</p>

<p>Services sector. It also engages in the following initiatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lean Six Sigma Initiative – Datamatics uses Six Sigma management techniques to achieve improvements in the areas of Productivity, Efficiency, Quality, and Customer Satisfaction. It has completed more than 320 Lean Six Sigma projects and 1600 Kaizen projects since 2007. It also has three Six Sigma Black Belt-certified professionals, one Six Sigma Master Black Belt-certified professional, 18 Six Sigma Green Belt-certified professional, and 25 Six Sigma White Belt-certified professionals.</li>
  <li>Certifications – Datamatics has had its processes assessed for compliance, and has received ISO 9001:2008, ISO 27001:2005, SEI -CMMI Version 1.3, SSAE 16, HIPAA, and ITIL certifications.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Customer Satisfaction Tracking – Datamatics completes a survey of its customers every six months to determine its Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Index. Its most recent index determined that its score was 4.73 on a scale of 1-6 (1 being the lowest and 6 being the highest), with a large number of customers rating the company a 6 out of 6 on all of the parameters.
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has several clients in the *Fortune *500 and offices in Australia, India, Poland, UAE, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the following:</p>
  </li>
  <li>The “Excellence in Industry Application“ Award at the Big Data &amp; Analytics &amp; Insights Summit</li>
  <li>CIO CHOICE 2016 Awards in the BI &amp; DMS categories</li>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. The company’s website features a “Resources” section that includes white papers, articles, brochures, webinars, and videos.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>BCG has a mass market business model, with little differentiation between customers. The company targets its offerings at firms of all sizes and industries seeking management consulting services.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>BCG offers four primary value propositions: convenience, customization, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates convenience by offering a three-step program for client enablement. The process involves a) identifying the capabilities necessary to win, b) developing better managers by providing them with a mix of managerial and technical skills, and c) developing next-level business platforms to maximize manager effectiveness. The program can be applied across industries.</p>

<p>The company offers customization through the second step of its enablement program. It develops programs with a curriculum tailored for specific managers and cohorts. For example, its “lean curriculum” has 24 modules, which are used in different combinations for different cohorts.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible client results. High-profile examples of these outcomes include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An industrial engineering conglomerate used BCG’s enablement program to obtain more than $25 million worth of positive results (e.g., savings)</li>
  <li>A rolling stock manufacturer used BCG’s lean transformation program to decrease lead times by 70% and increase productivity by 30%</li>
  <li>A government agency used a new BCG operating model to increase productivity by 15%</li>
  <li>A pest control company used BCG’s pricing and infrastructure improvement program to drive bottom-line improvements of over 250 basis points annually</li>
  <li>A building products company used BCG’s lean manufacturing program to create bottom-line improvements worth over $100 million within two years
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It is one of the world’s top management consulting firms, operating 85 offices in 48 countries.

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Concur has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offering at firms across industries and sizes whose employees need to fill out expense reports.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Concur offers five primary value propositions: convenience, cost reduction, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by simplifying operations for clients. It provides a solution that optimizes business travel, expense, and invoice management by integrating these activities. The solution can easily work with a customer’s existing systems, including human resources (HR), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and accounting systems. Lastly, its dashboard features a comprehensive set of standard reports, providing complete visibility into spending.</p>

<p>The company offers cost reduction by offering a free 30-day trial of Concur Expense. New customers can test out the solution with pre-loaded sample reports, card charges, and receipts.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. It claims to offer 70% time savings on expense reports, 49% time savings on travel planning, and 85% faster invoice processing (the solution reduces the time period from 35 to five days). High-profile examples of positive outcomes for specific clients include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acumed used Concur’s solution to comply wth physician-spend regulation, enabling it to eliminate paper expense reports and reduce travel booking fees by 30%</li>
  <li>Bourns used Concur’s solution to automate its processes, resulting in savings of 40% per expense report processed and annual savings of $126,000 in report procesing</li>
  <li>DHL used Concur’s solution to automate its processes, resulting in reduction of corporate card late fees to nearly zero and an adoption rate of over 90% for its travel booking tool</li>
  <li>Educational Data Systems integrated Concur’s solution with its own, resulting in a reduction of 50% in expense report reconciliation time and 70% in report processing time</li>
  <li>General Mills used Concur’s solution to standardize its processes, resulting in increased pollicy compliance and $1.4 million in cost savings within three years of implementation
 The company reduces risk by providing a “Service Status Dashboard“ on its website that offers up-to-the-minute information on service availability and performance (e.g., outages and partial outages).</li>
</ul>

<p>The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It serves over 32,000 clients in over 100 countries, processing 150 million billable transactions each year. On a daily basis, it processes over 357,000 expense reports and sees mobile uploads of over 580,000 receipts. Lastly, it has won many honors, including rankings on <em>Forbes‘</em>“100 Best Small Companies“ list (2010), CIOZone’s “50 Fastest-Growing Software Companies“ list (2009), Business 2.0’s “100 Fastest-Growing Tech Companies List (2007), and <em>BusinessWeek’s</em> “Top 100 Small Companies to Watch“ (2007).</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

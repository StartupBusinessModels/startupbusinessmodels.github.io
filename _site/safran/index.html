<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Safran has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at consumers, businesses, and governments.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Safran offers three primary value propositions: innovation, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company places a strong emphasis on innovation as part of its culture.  Approximately 30% of its global workforce is allocated for research and development efforts. Furthermore, in 2015, 7% of its total revenues were directed towards its R&amp;D budget.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by maintaining high security standards. It maintains the “Safran Code of Conduct” which establishes its principles and serves as a reference point for professional conduct. Safran also follows business compliance procedures adopted by its parent firm, The Safran Group. It has been awarded anti-corruption certification by independent auditors Mazars/ADIT.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It bills itself as the world leader in multi-biometric identification solutions (fingerprint, face, iris) and claims to be the only firm with expertise in every security technology. It also touts the following rankings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>#1 worldwide in ID documents integrating biometrics</li>
  <li>#1 worldwide for ABIS (Automated Biometrics Identification System) in fingerprints, iris, and face recognition solutions</li>
  <li>#1 worldwide for Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) for hold baggage</li>
  <li>#1 worldwide for trace detection equipment</li>
  <li>#2 worldwide for gaming and betting terminals</li>
  <li>#3 worldwide for smart cards
 Safran employs over 8,700 people in 57 countries and achieved revenues of over €1.9 billion in 2015. It deploys its solutions in over 100 countries. Lastly, it maintains one of the world’s largest R&amp;D centers that specializes in identification solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Safran’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, and participation in trade shows and conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Safran’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees.</p>

<p>The company’s website features a “Media” section that includes useful resources such as publications, newsletters, case studies, photos, and videos. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and         e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

It also forms research partnerships with various public entities such as schools, universities, laboratories, local authorities, and national governments in order to foster product innovation.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Safran’s main resources are its human resources, namely the engineers that design, develop, and/or manufacture its products. It maintains important physical resources in the form of its network of offices, facilities, and R&amp;D centers located in 55 countries worldwide.</p>

<p>Lastly, it places a strong emphasis on its intellectual property, with 629 patented inventions and more than 2,280 patent titles. In 2014 alone it filed 73 patents.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Safran has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely research/development, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of cost of goods sold, a variable cost, and sales/marketing, a fixed cost.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

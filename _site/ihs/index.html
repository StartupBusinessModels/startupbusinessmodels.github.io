<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>IHS has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at companies in capital-intensive industries, including aerospace/defense, chemical, automotive, energy, maritime &amp; technology, and healthcare. Its biggest 1,000 customers are responsible for approximately two-thirds of its revenue, though no one client accounts for over 10%.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>IHS offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility through its wide variety of product offerings. It has a vast selection of proprietary market data, analyses, and forecasts. The analyses include reports on thousands of technologies in 12 interconnected markets.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance. In 2016 it released a report that included the results of a survey of its customers. The publication included the following data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>73% of IHS customers give the company’s products an overall rating of “very good or excellent”. This figure has increased significantly from just 49% in 2010.</li>
  <li>77% of customers give the company’s information and analytics quality a rating of “very good to excellent”.</li>
  <li>Nine out of ten customer service e-mails and phone calls are responded to within 24 hours, 77% are resolved with one company interaction, and 90% of all problems are resolved to clients’ satisfaction.
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its performance. It offers its services to organizations of all sizes in over 180 countries. Its client base includes 72% of the Fortune Global 1000 and 77% of the Fortune Global 500. It employs almost 9,000 workers in 33 countries worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

  <li>product development and lifecycle management;</li>
  <li>application lifecycle management;</li>
  <li>management of global software development;</li>
  <li>service lifecycle management; and</li>
  <li>planning and delivery of service, and analysis of product intelligence

Among PTC’s customers are high-profile names such as 3M, BAE, Aegis, Adidas Group, Airbus, Porsche, Alstom Transport, Callaway Cars, and Deckers Outdoor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Americas are PTC’s largest market, accounting for 42% of the Company’s total revenue in 2015, followed by Europe, which accounted for 37%. The Company also recognizes revenue across Japan and the Pacific Rim.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>PTC provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The quality and reliability of its products, including its software, hardware and support services;</li>
  <li>Its marketing and sales reach, providing services and solutions directly across the Americas, Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim;</li>
  <li>Its industry expertise, with the Company employing highly-qualified technical and corporate staff across its two business segments;</li>
  <li>Its commitment to innovation, devoting a significant portion of its revenue to research and development activities each year.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>PTC operates a website at www.ptc.com, through customers are able to view the Company’s products and services. The Company operates the PTC e-store, which allows customers to purchase certain PTC products and services.</p>

<p>The majority of PTC’s revenue is generated through sales of products and services through the Company’s in-house direct sales team. PTC operates sales and support offices across the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the Pacific Rim.</p>

<p>These direct sales are supplemented by a network of authorised resellers, distributors and independent sales agents, which account for between 20% and 25% of PTC total sales. PTC also provides services via a number of strategic services partners, which assist PTC customers in implementing the Company’s products and solutions.</p>

<p>PTC expects to increase its dependence on channel partners as it continues to grow.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>PTC makes a number of its products and services available to customers on a self-service basis through its online store. This enables customers to make purchases and manage customer accounts without dealing directly with members of the PTC sales team.

<p>Despite this, the majority of PTC’s sales come via its direct sales teams, which provide a more tailored service to customers, ensuring that all requirements and client briefs are fulfilled. Many of the Company’s licensing and subscription contracts include technical support services, which enable customers to receive ongoing personalised care. PTC also provides a broad range of support resources to customers through its e-support portal, including downloads, guides, documentation and tips.</p>

<p>PTC also operates a PTC Community portal, through which customers can interact with one another, and several blogs, through which it provides information on company and industry developments. PTC is also able to interact directly with its customers through its Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google+, and SlideShare accounts.</p>

<p>The Company operates through two business segments: Software Products and Services, comprising the development, licensing and sale of various software products, as well as the provision of technical support services; and Services, which comprises the Company’s provision of ancillary services such as consulting, implementation, training, and cloud services, and the sale of computer-based training products.</p>

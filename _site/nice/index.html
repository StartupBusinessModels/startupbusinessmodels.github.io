They also include the consultants that provide advice and the customer service employees that provide support.</p>

<p>The company relies heavily on its intellectual property, with 135 U.S. patents and 50 patents issued in other countries, and over 72 patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Warby Parker currently operates exclusively in North America, with its domestic market of the US its principal sources of revenue. The Company also operates a similar service for customers in Canada. Warby Parker does not appear to have plans to expand its services to customers in Europe and Asia in the imminent future.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Warby Parker generates revenue through the design, manufacture, and sale of glasses and sunglasses to customers across North America. The Company has two revenue streams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Revenue derived from the sale of prescription and on-prescription eyewear through its online and mobile channels; and</li>
  <li>Revenue derived from the sale of prescription and on-prescription eyewear through its network of physical retail outlets.
 Warby Parker remains a privately-owned company, and as such dos not publish its financial results on its website. Reports suggest, however, that in 2015 the Company generated more than $100 million in annual revenue, up considerably on the $35 million recorded by the Company just two years earlier. The majority of the Company’s revenue appears to be derived through its online retail portal, however, the Company’s physical outlets account for a growing portion of its annual sales.</li>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Cerner has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company primarily targets its offerings at healthcare-related institutions, including managed care organizations, physician groups and networks, medical centers, home health agencies, imaging centers, blood banks, pharmacies, integrated delivery networks, and public health agencies. The majority of its sales come from hospitals and health systems. That said, it also offers its solutions to employers, academic research institutions, and governments.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Cerner offers three primary value propositions: convenience, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by providing an end-to-end, automated healthcare management solution. Its systems provide information for patients at every phase of the care process. This makes it easier for healthcare providers to be more effective at prevention and treatment and reduce costs.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance by producing positive outcomes for clients. Some high-profile examples include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lafayette General Health used Cerner data analytics to save 65 seconds per patient visit</li>
  <li>Via Christi Health used Cerner RevWorks to reduce A/R by $83 million</li>
  <li>Mission Health used Cerner Patient Observer to reduce patient falls to zero</li>
  <li>Rocky Mountain used Cerner’s PowerChart to dramatically reduce antipsychotics usage</li>
  <li>Vail Valley Medical Center used Cerner’s Model Experience to speed up doctor optimization</li>
  <li>Legacy Health used Cerner solutions to more efficiently track pathology specimens
 The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. It bills itself as the largest independent health information technology firm in the world, with its systems set-up in over 20,000 facilities. Its revenues have experienced five- and ten-year compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 14% or more. Also, its net earnings have seen CAGRs of 17% or more in recent five-year and ten-year periods. Lastly, Cerner has been recognized as one of the “World’s Most Innovative Companies” (<em>Forbes</em>) and as one of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” (<em>Fortune</em>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

Assistance is provided by its client service teams, which include operations leaders, technical team leaders, and systems-trained support analysts who can handle critical client requests. Service channels include phone (the Cerner Support hotline), online chat, and e-mail.</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is also a self-service element in the form of customizable educational and learning resources on its website. Specifically, the uLearn portal provides web-based and instructor-led training programs.</p>

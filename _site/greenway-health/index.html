<p>The site also has an online calculator that customers can use to determine the potential return on investment and total cost of ownership for its solutions. Despite this orientation, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>It has relied on funding from outside sources, raising $22 million from one investor as of November 2006.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Greenway Health has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and administration, both fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Greenway Health has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from the fees it charges to customers for subscriptions to gain access to its solutions.</p>

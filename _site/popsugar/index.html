<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>POPSUGAR has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at women aged 18 to 40.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<ul>
  <li>POPSUGAR – This lifestyle site provides multi-platform content across entertainment, fashion, beauty, fitness, food, and parenting. Specific content focuses on trends, tips, and updates, but it also includes a video series, live event coverage, shopping experiences, and celebrity/expert interviews.</li>
  <li>ShopStyle – A search portal that enables visitors to search, find, and buy the latest trends through a convenient shopping experience.</li>

  <li>Contributor Partnerships – The company operates POPSUGAR Voices, a program through which it invites third parties to produce content (namely articles) for its platform that focuses on women’s interests and passions and promotes their stories and diverse experiences.
 ### Key Resources</li>
</ul>

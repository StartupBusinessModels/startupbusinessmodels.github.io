HRS has branch offices in Paris, London, Warsaw, Shanghai, Rome, Milan, Istanbul, Barcelona, Moscow, Singapore, Japan, Sao Paulo, and New York.</p>

<p>HRS operates its flagship online reservation portal at www.hrs.de, which is available in more than 30 languages.

Customers are able to register for an account, make and cancel reservations, and manage their payment records through the Company’s online portal, as well as through its mobile apps, without interacting with members of the HRS sales team. The Company’s online portal typically serves one-time, single trip customers.</p>

<p>HRS aims to establish more long-term relationships with its corporate customers, who are required to consult directly with the Company’s sales representatives to discuss their requirements and budgets. This also enables the Company to offer its larger clients additional supplementary services, such as travel pattern analysis.</p>

<p>HRS provides a range of online resources to its customers, including white papers, as well as 24-hour customer service, which enables customers to contact HRS representatives by phone at any time. Corporate customers are also able to obtain personal assistance over the phone, by email or through an online contact form.</p>

<p>HRS also makes a range of advertising solutions available to customers, primarily companies and organisations operating within the travel sector.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>HRS partners with a range of businesses in order to enhance its own services and solutions. The Company’s partners include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Affiliate Partners, including travel agents and website that work to extend the Company’s sales and marketing reach to a broader online audience;</li>
  <li>Hotel and Hospitality Partners, including a network of more than 300,000 hotels and guest houses worldwide that make reservations available via the HRS portal; and</li>
  <li>Online Booking and Travel Management Partners, which integrate their own booking and reservation systems with HRS’s, with the Company’s booking system handling third-party reservations.
 The Company includes among its partners companies such as Amadeus, SAP, TravelSky, Sabre, Atlatos, and GetThere.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>HRS’s key resources are its technology and online platform, its IT infrastructure – including servers and data centres, its network of affiliate partners and participating hotels, and its personnel.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>HRS incurs costs in relation to the development and operation of its online platform, the maintenance of its IT infrastructure, the management and development of its partner network, and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<p>HRS operates an international network of offices, spanning Europe, Asia and the Americas, accruing fixed costs in the form of rental and utility fees.</p>

<p>The Company also employs a multinational workforce, representing costs in the form of salaries and benefits.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>HRS generates revenue primarily through the operation of its online reservation portal. The Company takes a commission on the nightly room price for all booking made through the Company’s booking website. The Company also generates revenue through the provision of various ancillary corporate services.</p>

<p>HRS additionally provides a range of advertising solutions to individual hotels, hotel chains, tourist boards and companies, including advertisement placed on its homepage, banner ads, and advertisement through its newsletter. The pricing model for its various solutions is available on its website, with prices going as high as €22,750 for a single week of homepage advertising.</p>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Sapiens has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at organizations in the insurance and financial services industries.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Sapiens offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired more than six firms since its founding, including StoneRiver, Maximum Processing, Insseco, IBEXI Solutions, and Harcase Software. This strategy has enabled it to greatly expand its capabilities and diversify its portfolio. It now offers solutions in the general insurance, property &amp; casualty, life, pension &amp; annuities, and reinsurance &amp; retirement markets.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for clients. Its customer engagement platform generates significant information about a client’s individual customers, enabling the client to make more targeted offers. Combined with the Sapiens Portal, the platform also provides multiple touchpoints between client and customer, resulting in more opportunities for active contact and thus more cross- and up-sell opportunities. Lastly, the company’s automated marketing tools set clients up effectively for immediate “push“ and “pull“ customer interactions and saves them time.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is a top provider of software solutions for the insurance industry. It has 2,500 employees operating out of over 21 offices across North America, EMEA, United Kingdom, and Asia-Pacific. It serves over 400 clients worldwide, including Eurolife, RAC Insurance, Aegon, Haverford, Aviva, and Hiscox.</p>

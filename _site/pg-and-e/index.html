    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-pge">Businessmodel of PG&amp;E</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>PG&amp;E provides electric and gas utility services to a broad spectrum of customers. The Company principally divides its electricity customers into five segments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Residential, comprising general consumers living in homes and residential buildings;</li>
  <li>Commercial, primarily comprising small and medium-sized businesses, as well as some larger enterprises;</li>
  <li>Industrial, comprising various engineering, manufacturing, and other industrial operators;</li>
  <li>Agricultural, comprising farming and agricultural operations; and</li>
  <li>Public street and highway lighting, comprising various government-sponsored public lighting projects.
 PG&amp;E divides its natural gas transportation customers into Core Customers – comprising small commercial and residential customers – and Non-Core Customers, comprising, industrial, large commercial, and natural gas-fired electric generation facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>PG&amp;E is a regional utility company. It provides electricity and natural gas utility services to a network of customers across northern and central California. The Company does not have any international operations, and does not appear to have imminent plans to expand its service to customers across the US.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>PG&amp;E provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its reputation and track record, with the Company established as a reliable provider of utilities across large parts of California, with a positive track record for good service dating back a number of years;</li>
  <li>Its extensive distribution infrastructure, with the Company operating around 42,000 circuit miles of electricity distribution lines and approximately 42,800 miles of distribution pipelines, enabling to distribute gas and electricity efficiently and effectively;</li>
  <li>Its diverse portfolio of energy sources, with the Company distributing electricity from a range of renewable – including solar and hydroelectric, nuclear, and fossil fuel power plants;</li>
  <li>Its accessibility, with the Company operating an online customer portal that enables its customers to pay bills and access resources online on a self-service basis; and</li>
  <li>Its specialist industry expertise and experience, with the Company employing highly-trained specialist personnel across its various operating divisions and units, as well as a team of experienced industry executives.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>PG&amp;E operates a website at www.PG&amp;E.com, through which it provides information on its various services, rate plans, coverage areas, and facilities. The Company also operates an online customer portal, which allows customers to view and pay bills, check account balances, and set-up recurring payments.</p>

<p>While customers are able to sign up for the Company’s services online, PG&amp;E’s are completed through its direct retail and wholesale sales teams, who operate out of the Company’s network of offices across California. Core Customers can purchase natural gas procurement service from PG&amp;E directly, or via various non-utility third party gas procurement service providers. When customers purchase gas supply from third-party providers, the Company continues to provide gas delivery, metering and billing services to customers. In most cases, however, PG&amp;E provides bundled services, whereby it provides both transportation and procurement services.</p>

<p>PG&amp;E operates an extensive electric distribution network, including approximately 142,000 circuit miles of electric distribution lines – of which around 20% are underground and around 80% are overhead, 58 transmission switching substations, and 603 distribution substations.

The Company provides utility services primarily under fixed-term contracts.</p>

<p>PG&amp;E provides a range of information and support resources to customers on its website, including energy saving tips, payment guides, and rate plans. Alternatively, customers can receive personalised responses to queries and complaints by contacting the Company’s support staff directly, either over the phone or via an online contact form.</p>

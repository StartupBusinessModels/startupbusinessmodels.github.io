<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost structure</h3>

<p>You see the burden when you realize that JD.com reported a 54% increase in cost of revenue to $24.2 billion in 2015, with leading cost drivers being direct sales activities and traffic acquisition to its marketplace platform. In the same year, the company said fulfillment expense, marketing expenses and technology expenses rose 73%, 93% and 88%, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue streams</h3>

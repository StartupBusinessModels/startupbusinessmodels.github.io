<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>MMC has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at firms of all sizes and industries.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>MMC offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, customization, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It operates four subsidiaries that present a broad range of services. These are Marsh, which offers insurance broking and risk management services; Guy Carpenter, which provides risk and reinsurance intermediary services; Mercer, which offers talent, health, retirement, and investment consulting services; and Oliver Wyman, which offers management consulting services.</p>

<p>The company enables customization by tailoring its services. Its Marsh &amp; McLennan Agencies division operates a hub and spoke structure, allowing decentralized leadership in its various regions so that clients can benefit from localized expertise (called a “local touch”). It also works to extend its regional capabilities by acquiring partner firms in nearby cities.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It employs 60,000 people worldwide and generates annual revenues of $13 billion. It is one the largest insurance brokers in the world in terms of revenues. It serves clients in over 130 countries. Its Marsh &amp; McLennan Agency division is the12th largest insurance broker in the United States, with annual revenues of $900 million. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recognition by <em>Institutional Investor</em> Magazine as a member of its 2017 All-America Executive Team, as having the #3 Overall CEO in the insurance industry, as being #3 with buy-side analysts, and as being #2 with sell-side analysts</li>
  <li>Ranking 29th on the 2012 Bloomberg Businessweek 50, an annual ranking of the S&amp;P 500’s top 50 performing companies
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>MMC’s main channel is its business development team. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, and participation in conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>MMC’s customer relationship is primarily of a dedicated personal assistance nature. It works closely with clients in order to help them with their risk, strategy, and people strategies. That said, there is a self-service component. The company’s website features an “Insights &amp; Analysis” section that includes reports and white papers.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>MMC’s business model entails designing, developing, and delivering it services to customers.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

It also shares best practices from other MMA partner firms.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>MMC’s main resources are its human resources, namely its network of 60,000 consultants and experts in risk, strategy, and people services worldwide.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

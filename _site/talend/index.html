<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Talend has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at firms seeking open source data integration software.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Talend offers five primary value propositions: innovation, convenience, performance, cost reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company has embraced innovation throughout its history. It was the first provider of commercially-available open source data integration software. It introduced the first open source master data management solution. Lastly, it offers the first data integration platform built on Spark.</p>

<p>The company creates convenience. Its main offering is a single solution that enables users to connect data and applications with the same interface and visual tools. They can be connected in the cloud or on-premises, in real-time or in batch format, and from big data to master data. In addition, Talend’s visual design tool is an eclipse-based designer that makes it simple to build integration jobs utilizing innovations such as machine learning, Spark, and Spark Streaming.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance. Its solution connects at big data scale, five times faster and at one-fifth the cost. Because the data integration platform is built on Spark, it gives clients up to 100 times better performance than any similar offering on the market.</p>

<p>The company reduces costs. It maintains a pricing model based on developers rather than volumes or data sources, which significantly lowers total cost of ownership. Moreover, its modern architecture decreases maintenance/installation costs, and its single design environment reduces training costs.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand as a result of its performance. It has over 500 employees operating in offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. It serves over 1,300 enterprise customers globally. These include several *Fortune *500 clients such as Comcast, eBay, General Electric, Samsung, Virgin Mobile, and Citi. Lastly, it has won many honors, including a ranking on the CRN Big Data 100 six times, a ranking on the DBTA 100 three times, a ranking on the SD Times 100 twice, several InfoWorld Bossie Awards, and an InfoWorld Technology of the Year Award (2009).</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

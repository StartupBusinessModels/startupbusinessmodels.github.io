</ul>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Flywheel Sports generates revenue through the operation of fitness and indoor cycle studios across the US and Dubai. The Company’s revenue is derived from three principal streams:</p>

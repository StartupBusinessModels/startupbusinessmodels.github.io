<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Okta generates revenue through the provision of various integrated system and cloud-based application solutions to customers across multiple industries. The Company principally derives its revenue under a subscription, as well as through service contracts. Okta principally offers its products to customers at between $1 and $4 per month, per user. Enterprises with more than 5,000 users are offered a custom quote.</p>

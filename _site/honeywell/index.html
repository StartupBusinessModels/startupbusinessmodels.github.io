<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Honeywell serves a range of customers across its three operating segments, primarily comprising industrial and corporate clients.</p>

<p>Honeywell’s Aerospace segment produces products and solutions for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft operators, military services, and defense and space contractors. Its sales are primarily made to original equipment manufacturers operating within the in the air transport, general aviation aircraft, and automotive and truck manufacturing industries segments. It also provides spare parts and after-market maintenance services to aircraft operators. The Company’s Automation and Control Solutions segment provides products to companies operating within the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical industries, while the Performance Materials and Technologies segment targets homes, commercial buildings and industrial facilities.</p>

<p>Sales to aerospace customers make up around 39% of Honeywell’s total sales, with sales to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers making up around 8%. The US Government is among the Company’s largest customers, accounting for around $3.74 billion in sales in 2015. The US is by far the company’s largest market, followed by Europe, with sales across the rest of the world amounting to around 15% of total sales.</p>

<p>The nature of Honeywell’s business requires that it establish collaborative relationships with its customers, consulting directly with customers in order to establish a clear brief that covers their individual needs and budgets. Honeywell aims to establish longstanding relationships with its customers that span a number of years, generating recurring business across its operating segments.</p>

<p>Honeywell provides various after-market support and maintenance services to its customers, who are able to contact the Company’s sales and support teams through an online contact form in order to receive personalised assistance.

  <li>Performance Partner Program, comprising technology, software, marketing, integration, and production partners that supplement the Company’s own offering and provide services on the Company’s behalf.

</ul>

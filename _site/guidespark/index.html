    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-guidespark">Businessmodel of GuideSpark</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>GuideSpark has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments.</p>

<p>The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes that desire more effective communication with employees around benefits and compensation.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>GuideSpark offers two primary value propositions: performance and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Its solutions have led to increases in employee sign-ups for benefit programs and reduced call center time. High-profile examples of positive outcomes for specific customers include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Baker Hughes used GuideSpark’s offerings to overhaul its open enrollment communication strategy, and witnessed a 77% reduction in administration costs, a 38% decrease in support calls, a 32% increase in health plan enrollment, and a 30% increase in wellness program participation</li>
  <li>Lionsgate used GuideSpark’s offerings to address performance management, and experienced an increase in employee participation in performance conversations from 50% to 70%</li>
  <li>OSI Systems used GuideSpark’s offerings to address health plan communication, resulting in a plan adoption level of 90%, a reduction in annual healthcare costs to 1%, and savings of $450,000
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its performance. It serves 10 million+ employees at over 650 enterprises, including 20% of the Fortune 500. Prominent clients include Adobe, Kaiser Permanente, Visa, ADP, Salesforce, and McDonald’s. It has also won a number of honors, including recognition as a“Top Workplace“ by the Bay Area News Group (2015), as the seventh fastest-growing private company in Silicon Valley (2015), and an award for “Best Use of Technology“ at the Employee Engagement Awards (2015).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>GuideSpark’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, and participation in conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>GuideSpark’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize the service through the main platform while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website features a “Resources” section that includes self-help tools such as white papers, case studies, data sheets, infographics, webinars, and videos.</p>

<p>That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of customer success and account management teams that check in with clients on at least a quarterly basis, an annual customer conference, and general phone and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>GuideSpark’s business model entails maintaining a robust platform for its clients.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>GuideSpark does not maintain an official partnership program; however, it does form strategic alliances from time to time to enhance its offerings.</p>

<p>For example, in 2015 it partnered with Businessolver, a benefits administration technology firm. Through the collaboration, GuideSpark embedded its video content and engagement platform directly inside Benefitsolver, Businessolver’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) benefits administration system .</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>GuideSpark’s main resource is its proprietary software platform, which serves more than 650 firms.</p>

<p>The company depends on its engineering employees to maintain and update the platform and its customer service staff to provide support.</p>

<p>Lastly, as a relatively new startup it has relied heavily on funding from outside parties, raising $42.2 million from six investors as of February 2015.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>GuideSpark has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing, a fixed expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and administration, both fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>GuideSpark has one revenue stream: the subscription fees it charges for access to its software platform. The fees vary in amount by company size and amount of content provided.</p>

    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-hubspot">Businessmodel of Hubspot</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Hubspot reportedly has around 18,000 active customers spanning more than 90 countries worldwide. It primarily serves advertising and marketing agencies, recruitment companies, e-commerce companies, education organisations, non-profits and business-to-business service providers, from small and medium-sized businesses to enterprise-level organisations.</p>

<p>While the Company’s primary market is the US, it also provides services to businesses across Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Among Hubspot’s partners are NEC, Heron Global Partners, Randstad, Granite State College, Shopify, Talent Clue and Bitdefender.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Hubspot’s greatest value is that it allows users to manage and control all of their inbound marketing content, across multiple channels, from one place, making customer relationship management, sales and marketing processes more efficient and manageable.</p>

<p>This is supplemented by Hubspot’s integration with third-party applications and service providers, as well by as its sales of third-party extensions and templates through the Hubspot marketplace.</p>

<p>The Company also provides ongoing support, both through its own team and through the user community it has fostered, and provides training and learning resources to its customer free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Hubspot’s products can be viewed and its accounts managed through its mobile and desktop websites at www.hubspot.com. Purchases can be completed through direct contact with the Hubspot sales team.</p>

<p>The Company’s cloud-based platform can also be accessed via the Hubspot website, as well as through its iOS and Android mobile apps.

Once registration has been completed, users can access the Hubspot platform and manage their accounts autonomously through the Hubspot website and apps.</p>

<p>In addition to providing tutorials and FAQs, Hubspot also allows users to submit feature requests directly to the Company and initiate technical support request from its homepage. It also enables users to join local Hubspot user groups, where users can discuss the platform in person and learn how to best use the software.</p>

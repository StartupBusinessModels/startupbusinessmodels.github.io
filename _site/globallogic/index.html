<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

Its staffers work out of “Delivery Centers” in the U.S., India, Ukraine, Argentina, Poland, Slovakia, and Croatia and “Method Studios” in the U.S. and UK. As a startup it has relied heavily on funding from outside parties, raising $42 million from two investors as of October 2013.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>GlobalLogic has a value-driven structure, aiming to provide a premium proposition through significant personal service and frequent product enhancements.</p>

<p>Its biggest cost driver is likely cost of services, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of product development, research/development, and sales/marketing, all fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>GlobalLogic has one revenue source: revenues from the contracts clients sign to obtain its portfolio of services. Sales staff must be contacted directly for pricing as it varies by client and other factors.</p>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Bonobos offers a range of clothing and accessories to the general consumer market. Its business model is built around providing a hassle-free, efficient and enjoyable process, through which men are able to purchase high-quality clothes for all occasions.</p>

<p>The Company has a specific target market, namely millennial males who do not enjoy traditional retail experiences. Bonobos typically serves male customers who prefer to shop for clothes no more than once or twice per year and appreciate a shopping experience during which they can receive fashion consultancy and fitting from a professional, and leave the store without having to carry it with them. Bonobos is also reported to operate a model with no-discounts, appealing to customers who do not enjoy the pricing complexity of traditional apparel retailers.</p>

<p>Bonobos serves customers primarily in its home market of the US, where it operates a network of guideshops across most major US cities, including Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and Washington DC. The Company also ships orders to select group of international locations, namely Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.</p>

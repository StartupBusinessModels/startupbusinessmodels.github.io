<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>ProSiebenSat.1 Media provides a range of services that are targeted at different customer segments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cable network, satellite, IPTV operators, television corporations and digital media platforms, to which the Company distributes and licenses original programming content;</li>
  <li>advertising agencies, commercial organisations, and brand marketers, to which the Company provides traditional television advertising, digital marketing and video marketing solutions; and</li>
  <li>general consumers, to which the Company provides pay-per-view and subscription media services and e-commerce products.
 ProSiebenSat.1 Media’s broadcast operations primarily serve customers across German-speaking Europe, notably Germany, Austria and Switzerland, with the Company’s native Germany representing its largest market. The Company’s other services are largely targeted at the US and UK markets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>ProSiebenSat.1 Media provides value to its customers through the quality of its original content, its range of advertising and marketing solutions and large audience, and its broad distribution network.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>ProSiebenSat.1 Media operates a website at www.ProSiebenSat1.de, where customers are able to find information on the Company’s products and services. The Company also operates video streaming and on-demand services through its www.prosieben.de and www.maxdome.de domains.</p>

<p>Across its core broadcast markets in German-speaking Europe, the Company operates several free-to-view television channels, including SAT.1, ProSieben, Kabel Eins, Sixx, SAT.1 Gold and ProSieben MAXX.

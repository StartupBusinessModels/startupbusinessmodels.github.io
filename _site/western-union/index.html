  <li>Revenue derived from foreign exchange revenues, based on the difference between the exchange rate set by the Company to the customer and the rate at which the Company is able to acquire currency.
 In 2015 Western Union generated annual revenue in the amount of $5.48 billion, down slightly on the $5.61 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. The majority of the Company’s revenue, around 79%, was attributed to the Company’s Consumer-to-Consumer segment. The Company’s Consumer-to-Business and Business Services segments accounted respectively for 12% and 7%.</li>
</ul>

    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-innodata">Businessmodel of Innodata</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Innodata has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs.</p>

<p>The company targets its offerings at trade, education, and professional publishing; telecommunications; information technology; aerospace &amp; aviation; defense; and law and legal services firms.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Innodata offers three primary value propositions: performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific positive outcomes for clients include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An information services firm used Innodata’s solutions to build a new content management and delivery infrastructure, resulting in a 40% reduction in overall product development costs</li>
  <li>A broadband access solutions provider used Innodata’s solutions to implement a single-source publishing system, resulting in expected savings of $1 million over three years</li>
  <li>A book publisher used Innodata’s solutions to re-engineer its production and editorial processes, resulting in expected annualized production cost savings of 10-15 percent</li>

  <li>A leading business intelligence provider used Innodata’s solutions to streamline the content acquisition process, resulting in a more than 30% increase in editorial staff productivity
 The company reduces risk by maintaining high security standards. Each of its facilities acts as a “mirror site”, with identical infrastructure, technology, and workflow designs. This means that work can be transferred seamlessly to another facility if necessary, with no interruption to the workflow. The facilities are all interconnected through multi-redundant data connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has over 5,000 employees operating out of eight countries.

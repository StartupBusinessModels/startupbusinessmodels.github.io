<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

It publishes white papers and a technology forecast.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results for clients. High-profile examples of positive outcomes include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DB AG used PwC’s services to integrate the accounting functions in its various business units, resulting in lower costs, higher quality and efficiency, and stronger coordination between units</li>
  <li>Avios used PwC’s services to combine the frequent flyer programs of its different airlines, resulting in improved tracking of transactions and higher transparency of value</li>
  <li>Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital used PwC’s services to reduce the“door-to-needle“ time for patients, resulting in a major reduction in the risk of damage by disease
 The company has established a powerful brand as a result of its success. It is the world’s largest professional services firm, and is also one of the “Big Four“ accounting firms, along with EY, Deloitte, and KPMG. It has over 208,109 employees operating in 157 countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>It works with over 100,000 businesses and entrepreneurs, and in 2015 provided services to 418 members of the *Fortune *Global 500 and 443 members of the FT Global 500. Lastly, it has won many honors, including recognition as one of *Fortune’s *“100 Best Companies to Work For“ for 12 years (2005 – 2016) and as the most prestigious accounting firm in the world for seven straight years by Vault Accounting 50.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

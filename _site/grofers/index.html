The Company serves customers across Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Noida, Pune, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Surat, Chandigarh, Kanpur, Agra, Indore, Nagpur, Ludhiana and Vadodara.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Grofers incurs costs in relation to the procurement of merchandise and services, the management of its vendor and merchant partnerships, the development of its online platform and website, the maintenance of its IT and communications infrastructure, the management of its partnerships, the implementation of marketing and advertising campaigns, and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Grofers generates revenue through the provision of grocery delivery services to customers in India. The Company operates under a commission-based revenue model, taking a commission from merchants for all orders placed through its platform. Reports suggest that this commission is around 8% for orders under INR 700 and 12% to 15% for order between INR 700 and INR 1,000.  Customers are charged only if their order is below INR 250, in which case the company takes a fee of INR 49 from the customer.</p>

<p>Grofers remains privately owned, and as such is not obliged to publish its financial performance figures online. Reports suggest, however, that in the year 2014 to 2015 the Company generated annual revenue of INR 8.6 million (approximately $127,000).</p>

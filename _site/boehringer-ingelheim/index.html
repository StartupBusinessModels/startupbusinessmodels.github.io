<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Boehringer Ingelheim serves customers from within the healthcare, pharmaceutical and animal health industries, as well as the general consumer market. Its end customers can be categorised broadly as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Healthcare organisations, including medical institutions and practitioners to which the Company provides a range of prescription medications;</li>
  <li>General consumers, for which the Company produces over-the-counter medicines for a range of minor ailments and illnesses;</li>
  <li>Veterinary organisations, including veterinary practices and practitioners, to which the Company provides a range of preventative and curative animal health solutions; and</li>
  <li>Pharmaceutical companies, to which Boehringer Ingelheim provides full-service contract manufacturing services.
 Boehringer Ingelheim sells a proportion of its products to distributors, agents, affiliates and resellers, which are then authorised to market and sell the Company’s products to end customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boehringer Ingelheim is a large multinational company with offices across the world. While it is based primarily in Europe, its customers are not limited by jurisdiction, with the Company serving customers across Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas and Australasia.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Boehringer Ingelheim provides value to its customers through its established reputation as a provider of quality and reliable products, its efficient contract manufacturing services, and its commitment to research and development.</p>

<p>Boehringer Ingelheim is one of the largest and oldest pharmaceutical companies in the world, and has established itself as a leader in its field.</p>

<p>The Company devotes a significant proportion of its revenue each year to research and development, in a bid to ensure it provides the most up-to-date products to its global customer base.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Boehringer Ingelheim operates a website at www.boehringer-ingelheim.com where customers can find information on the Company’s products and services.

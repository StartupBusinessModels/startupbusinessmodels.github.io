</ul>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>Weyerhaeuser operates a website at www.weyerhaeuser.com, through which it provides information on its products, services, target industries, and operating locations. The Company does not, however, operate an online sales channel, nor does it provide an online customer portal trough which customers can manage transactions and orders.</p>

<p>Weyerhaeuser makes sales to its clients through an in-house direct sales organisation, which deals directly with the Company’s clients. This sales force is organised by business segment and by geographic region, with the Company’s sales personnel operating out of an international network of dedicated sales and liaison offices across the US, as well as in Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Uruguay, Ireland, and France.</p>

<p>Weyerhaeuser operates its own network of manufacturing facilities and lumber mills across the US and Canada, as well as a facility in Poland. This infrastructure is supported by the Company’s in-house network of distribution centres and facilities.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Despite its online presence, Weyerhaeuser does not offer any of its products and services to customers on a self-service basis. The Company’s in-house sales personnel deal directly with clients, agreeing the details of individual sales and distribution contracts on a case-by-case basis. The Company seeks to establish longstanding relationships with its commercial clients, with a view too securing recurring business.</p>

<p>Weyerhaeuser has relationships and account management teams that are able to provide ongoing support to its larger clients. Customers can also make more general enquiries with the Company over the phone or via an online contact form, and receive personalised responses to queries and complaints. The Company also provides technical support resources to its customers, including product information, installation guides, and news articles.</p>

<p>Additionally, Weyerhaeuser operates social media accounts with Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, through which it is able to update clients with company development and interact with customers directly.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Weyerhaeuser operates as a real estate investment trust, and an owner of timberlands. The Company is principally engaged in the growing and harvesting of timber, as well as the manufacture, distribution, and sale of products made from trees.</p>

It serves an international customer base, spanning multiple industries, including the oil and gas, the construction and development, energy, and manufacturing sectors.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Weyerhaeuser’s key resources are its intellectual properties, its equipment and materials, its supply chain, its manufacturing and milling facilities, its sales and distribution operations, its partnerships, and its personnel.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Weyerhaeuser incurs costs in relation to the development of its solutions and processes, the procurement of supplies and materials, the operation of its manufacturing facilities and wood mills, the implementation of marketing campaigns, the operation of its sales and distribution infrastructure, the management of its partnerships, and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<p>In its 2015 annual report, Weyerhaeuser recorded total selling expenses in the amount of $113 million, and general and administrative expenses totalling 289 million. The Company recorded research and development costs totalling $24 million.</p>

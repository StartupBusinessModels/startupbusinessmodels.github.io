    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-ansys">Businessmodel of ANSYS</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>ANSYS has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company primarily targets its offerings at firms in the aerospace/defense, biomedical, automotive, energy, electronics, materials and chemicals processing, and semiconductor industries. Its products are primarily used by engineers, researchers, designers, and students.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>ANSYS offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, cost reduction, risk reduction, and brand.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. Its solution is available on a large range of hardware platforms. Furthermore, it has acquired over a dozen companies, which has enabled it to provide additional capabilities and innovations for customers.</p>

<p>The company reduces costs by enabling cheaper testing options. Customers are able to conduct test simulations, saving expenses that would arise from using physical prototypes. In fact, they are able to test thousands of designs in the time normally taken to build one prototype. The simulations are effective, enabling users to confirm how their ideas will work in the real world.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by ensuring the quality of its solution. It touts its analysis software as the first developed within a quality system with ISO 9001 certification, a globally-accepted standard. Furthermore, its testing, development, maintenance, and support procedures meet the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s requirements, and have for almost 40 years. Lastly, ANSYS employees carry out over 60,000 software verification tests before each new product release.</p>

<p>The company has established a powerful brand as a result of its success. Its software is used by over 45,000 customers, including 96 of the top 100 industrial firms on the Fortune 500. Specific prominent clients include Audi, Samsung, AirBus, and Medtronic.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>ANSYS’s main channels are its direct sales teams, which operate through 75 sales offices worldwide, and its network of independent channel partners (resellers and distributors) in more than 40 countries, which accounts for about 25% of revenues. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, and participation in seminars, trade shows, and conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>ANSYS’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company assists users in the following ways:</p>

<p>Support Services – ANSYS provides phone and e-mail support from customer service professionals.</p>

<p>Consulting Services – ANSYS provides a variety of consulting services for customers, including system deployment, product development assessment, and simulation workflow improvement. It also offers an “Embedded Expert”, a dedicated ANSYS employee that works hand-in-hand with the client to solve specific problems, and a “Mentoring Expert” that demonstrates effective use of the solution.</p>

<p>Training Services – ANSYS maintains the ANSYS Training Center, which offers FEA training, CFD training, HFSS training, Maxwell training, Icepak training, and various other types of engineering simulation training. The programs feature a wide range of courses.</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is also a self-service component. The company provides a customer portal where users can search a solutions database, locate product documentation, access training materials and best practice guides, download the latest software versions, and obtain real-time updates on the status of technical support requests. The company’s website also offers several self-help resources, including articles, brochures, case studies, white papers, webinars, and videos.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>In 2015 Baker Hughes generated revenue of $15.74 billion, a decrease of $8.81 billion, or 36%, compared to 2014. The Company attributed this decrease in revenue to a general decline in activity, and price deterioration experienced across all operating segments.

The majority of the Company’s remaining revenue was generated by its Europe, Africa, and Russian Caspian, and Middle East and Asia Pacific segments.</p>

    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-ncs-group">Businessmodel of NCS Group</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>NCS Group has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at organizations across industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>NCS Group offers five primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, innovation, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its capabilities include outsourcing, consulting, applications development, infrastructure management, systems integration, portal solutions, cloud computing services, and business analytics.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for customers. It utilizes a proprietary process called the Business Value Model (Bizval) for all of its client engagements. The process focuseds on the following three areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Outcome Focus – Defining the outcomes of change so that organizations can achieve clarity for their goals and objectives and establish full focus on their business pursuit.</li>
  <li>Stakeholder Centric – Helping firms garner multi-stakeholder collaboration and participation to ensure commitment to their goals.</li>
  <li>Time to Value – Reducing the time needed to deliver value by creating the sense of urgency required to gain focus and co-operation on high-value activities.
 The company places a strong emphasis on innovation. It maintains an initiative called Solutions for Urbanised Future (SURF) whose aim is to develop and produce innovative solutions that positively affect the lives of residents in a given area and transform public services. These services include transport, healthcare, education, and  public safety. The solutions are enabled by data and analytics, mobility, sensing technology, security, social networking, machine-to-machine, and the cloud.</li>
</ul>

<p>The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality standards. It has obtained several certifications, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 5</li>
  <li>ISO 9001 certified</li>
  <li>ISO 20000 IT Service Management System</li>
  <li>ISO 27001 Information Security Management System</li>
  <li>
    <p>SS507 Singapore Standard for Business Continuity
 The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. It bills itself as the leading information, communications and technology (ICT) service provider, with a presence in over 40 cities in more than 22 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific and Europe/the Middle East/Africa (EMEA). It has the largest pool of Certified IT Project Managers in Singapore. It has implemented over 3,000 large-scale, multi-platform, and mission-critical projects for Singapore’s government agencies and ministries, and has several blue-chip clients. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the following:</p>
  </li>
  <li>Ranking as the No. 1 Partner in ASEAN by Cisco Top Overall Business 2016</li>
  <li>The Knowledge Ready Organisation (KRO) Award 2016 from the Information &amp; Knowledge Management Society (iKMS) Singapore</li>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Mentor Graphics has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at large firms in the communications, computer, consumer electronics, semiconductor, networking, military and aerospace, multimedia, and transportation industries.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Mentor Graphics offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. Its customers use its products to test a broad range of electronic components and systems, including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems and software, and wire harness systems. Furthermore, its solutions are used in the design and development of many electronic products, including transportation electronics, IoT platforms, computers, medical devices, industrial electronics, manufacturing systems, and wireless communications infrastructure.</p>

<p>The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Its solutions enable clients to develop superior electronic products, increasing the accuracy of complex designs. It also helps them produce more quickly and cost-effectively, reducing product time-to-market schedules.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It touts itself as the only EDA provider with an embedded software solution. It recently generated annual revenues of $1.18 billion. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the “Best Design Solution” Supplier of the Year Award by TowerJazz (2015) and recognition of its Veloce Power Application as a Hot 100 Product by EDN.</p>

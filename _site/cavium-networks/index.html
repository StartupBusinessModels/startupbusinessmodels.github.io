<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Cavium has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company specializes in providing MIPS-based and ARM-based video, network, and security processors. It primarily sells its offerings to providers of wireless, storage, networking, and consumer electronic equipment. In 2015, five of its customers accounted for more than half of its revenues (55.3%).</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Cavium offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, customization, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of semiconductors. Its offerings enable storage, communications, intelligent networking, security, and video applications. The processors can provide functionality in broadband/consumer, enterprise, service provider, and data center equipment. They range in speed from 1Gbps to 100Gbps.</p>

<p>The company offers customization by providing products that are “systems on a chip”, or SoCs. They include a thoroughly integrated architecture, multiple or single processor cores, and customizable software based on a wide range of standard operating systems.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand because of its success. Its customers include many prominent firms, including Cisco, IBM, Motorola ECC, Juniper, Nokia, Radisys, Qualcomm, Alcatel-Lucent, and Citrix. It has won many prestigious honors, including the HPC Wire Editor’s Choice Award (2015), the Golden Bridge Award (2013), placement on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 (2014), and recognition as the “Most Respected Public Semiconductor Company” by GSA (2012).</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and administration, both fixed costs, and cost of revenue, a variable expense that includes the cost of buying wafers and assembly/test services.</p>

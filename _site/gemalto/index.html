    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-gemalto">Businessmodel of Gemalto</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Gemalto has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at businesses and governments.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Gemalto offers three primary value propositions: performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific examples of positive outcomes for clients include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fraser Health Authority utilized Gemalto’s authentication solution, IDPrime smart cards, for its healthcare staff, resulting in increased patient satisfaction and a 20% reduction in support costs</li>
  <li>British Sky Broadcasting Group used Gemalto’s IDPrime.NET Converged Badge solution for 4,000 users, resulting in reduced costs and increased security</li>
  <li>
    <p>AXA Technology Services used Gemalto’s authentication solutions to strengthen overall IT security by reducing password sharing, badge swapping, and network attacks
 The company reduces risk by maintaining high safety and security standards, as follows:</p>
  </li>
  <li>Its solutions utilize multi-factor authentication, making logging in more secure</li>
  <li>Its hardware security modules provide strong encryption, authentication, decryption, and digital signing services for a broad range of applications</li>
  <li>It maintains a centralized organization that focuses on the prevention of cyber security risks, called the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is the world’s largest producer of SIM cards. It generated €3.1 billion in revenues in 2015. It has over 14,000 employees operating out of 118 offices in 49 countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>It serves over 30,000 organizations in over 180 countries, and they include many prominent companies, such as Amazon Web Services, Verizon, Audi, and China Telecom. Its survey of customers in 2015 indicated that 86% of them were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with its service. Lastly, it has won a number of honors, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Cybersecurity Excellence Award for Best Multi-Factor Authentication Solution from the LinkedIn Information Security Community</li>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Gemalto’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize the service through the main platform while having limited interaction with employees.</p>

<p>The company’s website provides answers to frequently asked questions. It also provides access to an e-mail newsletter featuring product updates and industry trends; access to “Digital Security in Action”, an online magazine featuring articles about innovations; and access to print magazine “The Review”, which discusses trends in the mobile, payment, public sector, IT security, and M2M categories.</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a personal assistance component. Gemalto offers general phone and e-mail support. It also provides over 50 courses on digital security and communication technologies. The classes can be taken at public locations or conducted privately at company sites.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>It also maintains important physical resources in the form of 45 personalization and data centers, 27 research and software development centers, and 17 production facilities located worldwide. Lastly, it places a high priority on its intellectual property, and filed applications for 107 new patents in 2015.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Gemalto has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely cost of products, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and research/development, both fixed costs.</p>

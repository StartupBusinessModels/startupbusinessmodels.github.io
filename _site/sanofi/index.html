<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Sanofi serves a range of companies, organisations and individuals operating within the healthcare and medical research sector. The Company’s three business segments target slightly different areas of the healthcare sector:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its prescription drugs are sold primarily to wholesale drug distributors, independent and chain retail drug outlets, hospitals, clinics, managed-care organisations and government institutions, with rare disease products being sold directly to physicians;</li>
  <li>Its vaccines are sold and distributed through multiple channels, including physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, private companies and distributors in the private sector, and governmental entities and non-governmental organisations in the public and international donor markets; and</li>
  <li>Its animal health products are sold to veterinarians, pharmacies and wholesalers, depending on the regulations within each target market.
 Sanofi’s largest single market is the Us, which accounts for around 36.2% of its net sales, followed by sales in Western Europe, particularly in France and Germany, which represent around 21.7%. The Company also sells products across Asia, Eastern Europe and Turkey, and the Middle East and Africa.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Sanofi provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its brand recognition and reputation, being among the largest pharmaceutical firms in the world with a proven track record of providing quality and reliable products;</li>
  <li>Its technology and intellectual properties, as well as the technologies and properties licensed from its partners, which it uses to produce unique and innovative products;</li>
  <li>Its commitment to innovation, with the Company devoting a substantial portion of its annual revenue to research and development activities; and</li>
  <li>Its global sales and marketing reach, serving customers worldwide through a broad network of sales and marketing channels, supplemented by a number of distribution partners.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>Sanofi operates a website at www.sanofi.com through which its provides information to customers on its products, services and activities. The Company, however, does not operate an online sales channel.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Despite operating maintaining an online presence, Sanofi’s products are not available on a self-service basis. The vast majority of the Company’s sales are made following direct consultation with customers by members of the in-house sales force, allowing the Company to provide a tailored service to each of its clients. The Company seeks to establish multi-year contracts with customers, and secure recurring business.</p>

<p>Customers are able to contact members of the Sanofi team through an online contact form or over the telephone. The Company also has procedures in place for its healthcare customers to report any adverse events associated with its products.</p>

<p>The Company has intellectual property rights secured in a number of jurisdictions, including numerous patents in the US. Searches of records published by the US Patent and Trademark Office identified a number of patent applications filed in Sanofi’s name, including applications entitled ‘Process for preparation of dronedarone by oxidation of a hydroxyl group’, ‘Drug delivery device with an improved piston rod’ and ‘Antibodies to kallidin and des-Arg.sub.9-kallidin’.</p>

<p>Sanofi also accrues significant administrative costs relating to the payment of salaries and benefits to its workforce of more than 100,000 employees, as well as rental and utility fees associated with the operation of its various offices and research facilities.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Sanofi generates revenue through the production and sale of pharmaceutical and healthcare products, including prescription medications, vaccines, medical devices, medical solutions and animal health products.</p>

    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-aginity">Businessmodel of Aginity</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Aginity has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at organizations of all industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Aginity offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its Aginity Workbench solution works across various systems, including Hadoop, dashDB, Big SQL, Amazon Redshift, Pivotal Greenplum, and IBM PureData for Analytics (Netezza).</p>

<p>The company creates convenience by making life simpler for clients. Its Aginity Amp solution catalogs all of a client’s analytics and data in an accessible software layer so that any individual user can build, edit, and reuse the assets. This enables quicker investigation of inconsistencies across applications.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. It claims its Aginity Amp solution offers the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>50-75% increase in data scientist and analyst productivity</li>
  <li>10x-100x efficiency through analytic reuse</li>
  <li>Up to 90% decrease in analytics-related operational costs
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. Its Aginity Workbench solution is used by over 60,000 data analysts, developers, and DBAs across most *Forbes *2000 companies. Aginity’s specific clients include Orkin and Homemakers. The company has also won a number of honors, including a 2017 IBM North America Top Independent Software Vendor Leadership Award.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Aginity’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, and participation in events such as summits and conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Aginity’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website features a “Support” section with product documentation.</p>

<p>That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support. There is also a community element in the form of a forum.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Aginity’s business model entails designing and developing its products for customers.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>Aginity’s key partners are the firms that provide support for the deployment of its software. Specific partners include Hortonworks, Cloudera, and IBM.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Aginity’s main resources are its human resources, who include the engineers that design and develop its solutions, the sales employees that promote them, and the customer service personnel that provide support.</p>

<p>As a startup it has relied on funding from outside parties, raising $13.8 million as of December 2015.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Aginity has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing costs, a fixed expense.</p>

<p>Other major drivers are in the areas of administration and customer support/operations, both fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Aginity has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from the sale of its software products to customers.</p>

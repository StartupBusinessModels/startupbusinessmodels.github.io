    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-pepsico">Businessmodel of PepsiCo</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>PepsiCo produces, markets and sells a broad portfolio of consumer-focused food and drink products. The Company, however, is not directly consumer-facing, instead serving a range of commercial customers. PepsiCo’s customers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Food and Beverage Distributors, including independent distributors and wholesalers</li>
  <li>Foodservice Businesses, including restaurant chains, cafes and coffee houses, and eateries;</li>
  <li>Retailers, including grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers, and membership stores; and</li>
  <li>Independent Bottlers, to which the Company sells branded beverages.
 PepsiCo serves a global customer base. While the Company’s principal market is its native US, it also serves customers across Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>PepsiCo provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its industry standing and reputation, with the Company established as one of the largest and most recognisable names in the consumer goods industry, with a track record for providing efficient and reliable services;</li>
  <li>The efficiency and sustainability of its production and distribution infrastructure, with the Company utilising state-of-the-art facilities to make and deliver products for customers in a sustainable way;</li>
  <li>The size and quality of its brand portfolio, with the Company producing and marketing a broad range of brands, including some of the world’s most popular food and beverage products, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Doritos, and Lay’s; and</li>
  <li>Its international sales and marketing reach, with the Company providing consumer goods to a global customer base, and operating dedicated geographically focused units for operations across Latin America, Europe Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, Middle East and North Africa.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>PepsiCo operates a website at www.pepsico.com - as well as a number of regional and branded websites – through which it provides information on its various brands, services, and operating locations. The Company does not operate an online sales channel for its core business. It does, however, operate an online store at www.shop.pepsi.com, through which it sells Pepsi-branded merchandise.</p>

<p>PepsiCo serves its customers directly through its in-house sales and marketing teams, which are organised by operating segment and geographic regions. The Company’s products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery, customer warehouse, and distributor networks. Some of PepsiCo’s products are delivered directly from its our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses, with some beverages being distributed by the Company’s independent bottlers customers through their own direct distribution channels to retail stores.</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions PepsiCo collaborates with third-party vending and foodservice distributors and sales agents. The Company also markets products through joint ventures, including Lipton tea products in partnership with Unilever, and co-branded juice products in partnership with China’s Tingyi.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>PepsiCo makes some sales of merchandise on a self-service basis, with customers able to purchase and organise delivery of certain Pepsi-branded products without interacting with members of PepsiCo’s sales personnel.</p>

<p>PepsiCo sales are principally made through its direct sales teams, which work closely with customers to establish the details of sales agreements. The Company seeks to establish longstanding relationships with its customers, providing financial incentives to assist in the distribution and promotion of its products, including incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions, and displays. PepsiCo typically grants independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products within a specific geographic area.</p>

<p>Customers can contact PepsiCo – as well as specific PepsiCo brands – with support queries, over the phone or via online contact forms. The Company also operates social media accounts with Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn, through which it can interact directly with customers.</p>

</ul>

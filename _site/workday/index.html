<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Workday has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at firms across industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired numerous firms since its founding, including five in the last two years alone: Gridcraft, Platfora, Zaption, Mediacore, and Upshot.

Lastly, its customers go live in 8.2 months on average.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has more than 1,350 customers, including several prominent firms such as Adobe, Church &amp; Dwight, Electronic Arts, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sony, Toyota, Visa, and Warner Music Group.

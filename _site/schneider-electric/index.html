    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-schneider-electric">Businessmodel of Schneider Electric</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Schneider Electric has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at consumers and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Schneider Electric offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired several firms since its founding, including Telvent, Triconex, Summit Energy, TAC, and M&amp;C Energy Group. This strategy has enabled it to expand its capabilities and diversify its portfolio.</p>

<p>The company embraces innovation as a part of its culture. Its innovative efforts include the following:</p>

<p>Connected Products – The company incorporates smart, connected technology into all of its device (UPS, drives, energy storage, MV switchgerar, LV panels, circuit breakers, and remote terminal units) so they are able to digitally transmit data.</p>

<p>Edge Control – The company overlays connected products with software and hardware to make real-time control and automation decisions at the local, operational level.</p>

<p>Apps, Analytics &amp; Services – The company‘s enterprise-level software, analytics, and applications take the data aggregated from the levels described above and transform it into operational intelligence.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has over 170,000 employees and generated revenues of €25 billion in 2016. It serves customers in more than 100 countries. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ranking at #5 in Gartner’s list of Top European Supply Chain Organizations (2016)</li>
  <li>Recognition as one of America’s Best Large Employers by <em>Forbes</em> (2016)</li>
  <li>Recognition as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere (2016)</li>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. Schneider Electric operates Energy University, an eLearning program that offers over 200 training modules on a self-paced basis.</p>

<p>The company’s website also provides a number of useful resources, including white papers, infographics, videos, product documentation, a BIM library, and a product substitution tool. Lastly, the site provides answers to frequently asked questions and access to an e-mail newsletter.</p>

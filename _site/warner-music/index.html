<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Warner Music serves a range of clients through its Recorded Music and Music Publishing segments. The majority of the Company’s physical sales are made to wholesalers, distributors or retail chains, as well as music specialty stores, general entertainment specialty stores, supermarkets, mass merchants and discounters, and independent retailers. This includes large retail groups such as Amazon, Best Buy and Barnes and Noble.</p>

<p>Warner Music also licenses its content to a variety of media customers through which it reaches consumers, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Streaming services and internet radio platforms, including well-known operators such as Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and YouTube;</li>
  <li>Digital download services, such as iTunes and Google Play; and</li>
  <li>Television and motion picture studios.

</ul>

  <li>Its standing and reputation within the music industry, being one of the oldest and most established companies in its industry, considered one of the “big three” music publishing groups, and including major music labels such as Atlantic Records and Parlophone; and</li>

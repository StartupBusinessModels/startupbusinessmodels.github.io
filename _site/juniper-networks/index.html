<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Juniper has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at organizations that depend on high-performance networks to deliver mission-critical transactions, services, and applications. Its most common customers are service providers (wireless and wireline carriers, cable operators, and Internet content/application providers), governments agencies and organizations (federal, state, and local), financial services firms, energy/utility companies, and research/education institutions.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Juniper offers three primary value propositions: innovation, convenience, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company places a strong emphasis on innovation. It developed and marketed the first commercially-available purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the unique high-performance needs of service providers. It also maintains OpenLabs, a set of centers for new innovations.</p>

<p>The company’s offerings create convenience through ease of use. Its Junos Platform features a single modular operating system (Junos OS) with common base of code and a single, consistent implementation for each control plane feature. It also offers one common modular software architecture that scales across all Junos-based platforms.</p>

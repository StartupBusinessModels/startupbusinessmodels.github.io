    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-synnex">Businessmodel of Synnex</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Synnex has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The company’s Technology Solutions unit distributes its products to system integrators, resellers, and retailers.</li>
  <li>Its Concentrix unit targets its offerings at enterprises in 10 industries: automotive, consumer electronics, banking/financial services, government/public sector, insurance, healthcare/pharmaceuticals, media/communications, travel transportation/tourism, retail/eCommerce, and technology.
 ### Value Proposition</li>
</ul>

<p>Synnex offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. It distributes over 30,000 technology products from over 300 IT, consumer electronics, and OEM suppliers. It has acquired many firms over the years, enabling it to expand its selection. For example, in July 2016 it acquired Minacs and integrated its operations into Concentrix, strengthening its automotive sector expertise.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by supporting its products with related business process services. It offers its buyers customer management, web hosting, software development, hosted software, back office processing, and domain name registration. These services help save time and costs.</p>

<p>The company has established a powerful brand as a result of its success. It serves more than 20,000 resellers (corporate, government, and value-added), retailers, and system integrators throughout the U.S., Canada, and Japan. It maintains operations in 26 countries and has over 70,000 employees with fluency in more than 40 languages. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the Operational Excellence Award from HSN for five years in a row, placement on the Top 100 List of Best Outsourcing Providers by IAOP (2016), and the National Quality Award from Golden Peacock (2016).</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Synnex’s main channels are its direct sales force, which includes regional sales teams, and its business development/product management specialists, who sell solutions for specific end-market verticals.</p>

<p>The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, and a roadshow series called “Secret Sauce” at which it gives presentations in different locations that introduce customers to new solutions and services and provide marketing advice.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Synnex’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its solutions while having limited interaction with employees.</p>

<p>That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone, e-mail, and online chat support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Synnex’s business model entails distributing third-party products to its customers as well as developing and manufacturing its own products.</p>

Its Concentrix segment operates 90 delivery centers and administrative facilities in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific.</p>

<p>The company depends on its sales personnel to distribute products. Lastly, its manufacturing is conducted in assembly plants in California, Tennessee, and the UK.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Synnex has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation and low-price value propositions. Its biggest cost driver is cost of products, a variable expense. Other major drivers are cost of services, a variable cost, and sales/administration expenses, a fixed cost.</p>

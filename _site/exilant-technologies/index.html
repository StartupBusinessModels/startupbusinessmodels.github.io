</ul>

<p>Exilant operates a website at www.exilant.com, through which it provides information on its various services, solutions, target industries and operating locations. While the Company provides a range of software solutions, the Company does not operate an online sales channel. Nor does it operate an online client portal, through which customers can manage their accounts. Customers can, however, register an interest in the Company’s various products via email or through an online contact form.</p>

<p>Exilant makes its sales primarily through its in-house direct sales force, which is organised by geographic region. The Company maintains sales and administrative offices across Asia Pacific, Europe, and the US, including locations in India, the UK, Singapore, and Switzerland, through which its sales personnel operate.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Despite its software offerings and its online presence, Exilant does not make sales to its clients on a self-service basis. The Company does, however, allow clients to register an interest in its products independently through an online contact form.</p>

<p>Exilant makes its sales primarily through its in-house sales force, the members of which consult closely with clients in order to ensure that their individual needs are met. Where possible, the Company seeks to provide solutions that are tailored and scaled to suit its customers on a client-by-client basis, with a view to establishing long-term relationships and securing recurring business.</p>

<p>Exilant offers ongoing support to its clients, who are able to contact the company over the phone, via email, or through an online contact form in order to access personalised guidance. The Company provides information on its various products and solutions on its website, but does not publish online support resources.</p>

<p>Exilant does, however, operate several social media accounts – including with Facebook, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter – through which it is able to publish company updates and interact directly with customers.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>Exilant works closely with a network of partner companies and organisations in order to ensure that its solutions are effective and reliable. These partners can be organised broadly into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supplier and Vendor Partners, comprising suppliers of services, equipment, and technologies that are utilised in the development and implementation of the Company’s various solutions, as well as companies to which certain non-technical functions can be outsourced;</li>
  <li>Channel and Distribution Partners, comprising the Company’s network of resellers, distributors, and sales agents that assist in extending the Company’s sales and marketing reach across various jurisdictions;</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Exilant’s key resources are its proprietary technologies and intellectual properties, its software solutions and service offerings, its IT and communications infrastructure, its sales and distribution channels, its partnerships, and its personnel.</p>

<p>Exilant utilises a range of proprietary technologies in the development and implementation of its solutions. Searches of records published by the US Patent and Trademark Office identified several patent applications in which Exilant was named either as applicant or assignee, including applications entitled ‘Increased communication security’, ‘Communication with accessories’ and ‘Method and system for client-side user interface enhancement to enable application integration and portalisation’.</p>

<p>Exilant additionally owns and or leases a number of physical properties around the world that comprise the Company’s network of sales and administrative offices.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Exilant incurs costs in relation to the development of its technologies and solutions, the maintenance of its IT and communications infrastructure, the operation of its sales and distribution channels, the procurement of professional services, the implementation of marketing and advertising campaigns, and the retention of its personnel.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Exilant generates revenue through the provision of various business-focused information technology services and software solutions to clients across the financial services, retail, consumer goods, construction, public sector, and textile industries. The Company derives its revenue under sales and service contracts agreed with its clients on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Exilant remains a privately owned company, and as such it is not obliged to publish its financial results online. Research did not identify any media reporting concerning the Company’s revenue performance.</p>

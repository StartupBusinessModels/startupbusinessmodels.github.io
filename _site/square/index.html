<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Square has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Square offers seven primary value propositions: accessibility, price, convenience, customization, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by enabling businesses of any size to easily accept card payments. The service is particularly beneficial for small firms and one-man shops. Clients can accept Visa, Discover, American Express, and MasterCard payments, as well as Android Pay, Apple Pay, EMV chip cards, and magstripe cards. Lastly, Square allows them to connect their existing service applications with its solution so they can sync price, item, and sales data.</p>

<p>The company offers a pricing value proposition. It offers its magnetic stripe card readers to businesses for free. Its charges for other readers but costs are low, and it provides bulk purchase discounts. Lastly, Square charges a single, low rate of 2.75% per card transaction – compared to typical payment processors that charge multiple fees, such as authorization, chargeback, statement, gateway, batch, PCI compliance, return, non-qualified, business card, international card, and early termination fees. The company offers no long-term contracts, no set-up fees, and hidden fees.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making its offering easy to use. It only takes a few minutes for businesses to sign up and no credit checks are required. Clients can see how their business is doing across their locations on their mobile devices through a Dashboard with a real-time reporting feature. Also, they do not have to wait long for payment – funds are usually deposited in a client’s bank account the following business day and can be deposited the same day for a 1% fee.</p>

<p>The company enables customization. Clients receive point-of-sale (POS) kits with guides that explain how to set up devices and software. The guides and kits are tailored by industry sub-sector (retail, food trucks, pop-up shops, salons/spas, bakeries/cafes, and bars/restaurants). Also, clients can use their Square data to develop custom apps.</p>

<p>The company has demosntrated strong performance through tangible results. It claims that clients that use its customer engagement tools for a given customer visit witness a spending rate on the next visit that is 20% higher than normal.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by maintaining high satisfaction and security standards. It offers free 30-day returns for hardware purchases and a one-year limited warranty for Square Readers. It also encrypts transactions at the point-of-purchase, monitors money until it is deposited in the seller’s bank account, and ensures that all of its software and hardware follow PCI data security standards.</p>

<p>The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. Its clients processed $35.6 billion in 2015, representing 712 million card payments from 190 million cards. Also, approximately 50% of of independent businesses in the U.S. now have access to its Square Payroll solution.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Square’s main channels are its direct sales team and its website. The company promotes its offerings through its social media pages, search engine marketing, display advertising, radio and TV advertising, print media, direct mail campaigns, and trade shows and events.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Square’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Clients utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website provides guides for their point-of-service kits that explain what to do in detail and enable rapid set-up. It also features a Support Center that includes articles, videos, and tips.</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone, e-mail, and social media support. The company provides 24/7 support for larger businesses. There is also a community element in the form of a forum for clients.</p>

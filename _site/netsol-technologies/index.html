<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>NetSol has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at firms in the global leasing and finance industry.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>NetSol offers three primary value propositions: convenience, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for customers. Its solution is a fully-automated system that covers the entire leasing and finance lifecycle.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality and security standards. It has cleared ISO 27001, ISO 9001, and SEI CMMI Maturity Level 5 (V1.2) assessments, an accomplishment shared by less than 150 companies worldwide. It also operates an “Independent System Review“, a process through which it tests software applications extensively for customers before they go live.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has worked with over 200 finance and leasing companies in more than 30 countries since its founding. It has delivered over 300 implementations with a 100% project success rate. Lastly, it was the first IT firm in the finance and leasing industry to launch a complete line of enterprise mobility applications.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>NetSol’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, advertising, sponsorships, and participation in expos, forums, conventions, and conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>NetSol’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company utilizes consultants to assist clients with the system implementation process, which can last from three to 18 months depending on scope and complexity.</p>

<p>The process includes activites such as configuration, training, and data migration. Post-implementation, consultants may remain at the client’s site to facilitate a smooth transititon and make further enhancements. At this time, NetSol also provides regular maintenance and support services.</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. The company’s website features a “Resource Center” that includes articles and downloads such as white papers and infographics.</p>

<p>It has important physical resources in the form of eight strategically located support and delivery centers worldwide.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>NetSol has a value-driven structure, aiming to provide a premium proposition through significant personal service and frequent service enhancements.</p>

<p>Its biggest cost driver is cost of revenues, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of administration, sales/marketing, and research/development, all fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

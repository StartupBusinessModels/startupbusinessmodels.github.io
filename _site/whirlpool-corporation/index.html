</ul>

<p>Whirlpool’s main channels are the retailers, manufacturers, and distributors who resell its products. The company promotes its offering through its social media pages and advertising.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Whirlpool’s relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

<p>There is also a co-creation component. The company’s website invites visitors to submit patented ideas for consideration as product introductions or enhancements.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Whirlpool’s business model entails designing, developing, and manufacturing its products for customers.</p>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>Whirlpool’s key partners are the suppliers who provide it with raw materials and major components for use in the manufacturing of its products. They are given access to a Supplier Portal through which they can view helpful resources. The company also heavily depends upon the retailers, manufacturers, and distributors who resell its products in their outlets.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Whirlpool’s main resources are its physical resources, which include its collection of <em>70</em> manufacturing and technology research centers worldwide and its 14 manufacturing plants (nine in the United States, five in Mexico). It also depends on human resources in the form of its engineers that design, develop, and manufacture its products.</p>

<p>Lastly, it places a high priority on its intellectual property, considering the trademarks, licenses, and patents it owns to be valuable assets.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Whirlpool has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation and low-price value propositions. Its biggest cost driver is cost of products sold, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and administration, both fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>Whirlpool has two revenue streams:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Product Revenues – Revenues it generates from sales of its products to consumers.</li>
  <li>Licensing Revenues – Revenues it generates from the royalties it receives from the licensing of its trademarks to third parties to manufacture, sell, and service certain products bearing the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, and Amana brand names.</li>
</ol>

    <h2 id="businessmodel-of-squarespace">Businessmodel of Squarespace</h2>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Squarespace has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customers. The company targets its offering at anyone who wants to build a website, from regular consumers to artists to entrepreneurs and beyond.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Squarespace offers four primary value propositions: cost reduction, convenience, customization, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company reduces costs through various features. First-time users are allowed a free trial. Annual subscription accounts receive a free custom domain for a year. Students receive a 50% discount on their first year of use. Lastly, customers can stop their service at any time with no fee charged.</p>

<p>The company creates convenience in multiple ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its reliable cloud infrastructure means users do not have to install, patch, or upgrade</li>
  <li>Creating websites is simple and intuitive, only requiring the click of a mouse to arrange content</li>
  <li>Retailers can design a quality online storefront without a single plug-in</li>
  <li>Site owners can see visitor traffic and behavior in real-time
 The company offers customization by providing hundreds of customizable style settings, including colors, fonts, and page layouts. Further, each design has personalizable content areas utilizing Squarespace’s LayoutEngine and Content Block System. Pages, footers, sidebars, and blog posts can utilize all Content Block types (e.g., audio, video, text, markdown). Users can apply Custom CSS to any template through the firm’s built-in custom CSS editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It has more than one million paying customers, including companies in hundreds of industries. These include prominent brands such as Rodate, Tokyobike, V Magazine, Freemans, Lyft, and Fast Company. Moreover, Squarespace has won many honors, including four Webby Awards (2014), the Critics’ Choice CMS Award for Best Website Builder (2013), and recognition as one of <em>Time’s</em> “50 Best Websites” (2012).</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Squarespace’s main channel is its website, through which it acquires most customers. The company promotes its offering through its social media pages and online/TV advertising.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Squarespace’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize the service through its website while having limited interaction with employees. The site features a number of self-help resources, including articles, guides, videos, consumer and developer documentation, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<p>Despite this orientation, there is a personal assistance component provided by the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>24/7 phone customer service from individuals with extensive Squarespace experience</li>
  <li>Workshops offering in-person guidance on building an online brand (offered at New York headquarters)</li>
  <li>Squarespace Circle, a group consisting of significant Squarespace users (those with three or more active websites); they receive perks such as exclusive content (product release notes, advanced guides) and six-month trial periods for new projects
 There is also a community element in the form of a peer forum called “Squarespace Answers.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

Lastly, as a startup it has relied on funding from outside parties, raising $78.5 million from three investors as of April 2014.</p>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Northwestern has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customers. The company targets its offerings at all consumers seeking insurance services.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Northwestern offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. It has acquired many firms since its origin, which has enabled it to greatly expand and diversify its offerings. Its products include life insurance, long-term care insurance, disability income, investments, annuities, and investment advisory products and services. Meanwhile, its services include retirement planning, estate planning, business planning, education planning, trust and private client services, and consultation on wealth and asset income protection.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk by maintaining high safety and security standards. It operates a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) whose purpose is to prevent, detect, investigate, and resolve potential fraud. It also works to assist law enforcement authorities in prosecuting confirmed offenders.</p>

<p>The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. It is the largest direct provider of individual life insurance in the U.S., placing first in market share. It ranks among the top 10 independent broker-dealers in terms of total revenues, with $27.9 billion in revenues in 2015. It manages $238.5 billion in assets and over  $1.6 trillion worth of life insurance protection. It has 4.4 million customers and has a 96% persistency rate (a measure of customer retention) for life insurance in force. It has the highest financial strength ratings awarded by three of the major rating agencies: A.M. Best Company (A++), Fitch Ratings (AAA), and Moody’s Investors Service (Aaa). Lastly, it has won many honors, including a ranking at #100 on the 2016 <em>Fortune</em> 500 and recognition as one of the “World’s Most Admired” life insurance companies by <em>Fortune.</em></p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Northwestern’s main channels are its website and its direct sales team. The company promotes its offering through its social media pages, sports sponsorships, and participation in conferences.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Northwestern’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize its products and services while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website features a “Northwestern Mutual Learning Center“ that includes self-help resources such as articles, white papers, brochures, commentaries, podcasts, webcasts, educational videos, and calculators.</p>

<p>It also has a “Studies and Research” section that includes studies and polls on financial topics. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Northwestern’s business model entails designing and developing its products and services for customers.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Northwestern has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation and low-price value propositions. Its biggest cost driver is cost of insurance benefits provided. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and administration, both fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<h3 id="key-partners">Key Partners</h3>

<p>LivingSocial manages a network of merchant partners that contribute the products, activities and experiences sold through the Company’s online marketplace. These partners primarily comprise small, local businesses such as restaurants, bars, hotels, travel and tour operators, craft shops and independent retailers.</p>

<p>Merchant partners are not charged any upfront fees, with LivingSocial instead taking a commission on sales made through its online marketplace.</p>

<p>Among LivingSocial’s merchant partners are local restaurants such as the Motor Bar and Restaurant in Milwaukee and the Edge Bar and Restaurant in Denver, local attractions like the Maryland Science Centre and the Day Block Brewing Company in Minneapolis, and national operators such as Delta Airlines.</p>

The size of these commissions varies from deal to deal, with marketing fee thresholds negotiated with sales representatives directly.</p>

<p>Comments from LivingSocial customers across the internet cite commission rates of between 20% and 50%, with the average rate appearing to be around 30% to 35% of each sale. Merchants receive their share of revenue generated by their products once LivingSocial has deducted its marketing fee. For fiscal year 2014 the Company generated a total of $231 million.</p>

<p>LivingSocial’s secondary revenue stream is advertising. The Company provides a range of advertising solutions to brand marketers and advertising agencies that are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis.</p>

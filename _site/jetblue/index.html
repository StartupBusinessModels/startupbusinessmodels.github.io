<p>JetBlue’s largest expense relates to the payment of salaries and benefits to its workforce of more than 18,000 employees, with personnel costs amounting to $1.54 billion in 2015. The acquisition of aircraft fuel is one of JetBlue’s most significant expenses, with prices and availability fluctuating due to unpredictable global economic and geopolitical factors.</p>

<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>WSO2 has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>WSO2 offers four primary value propositions: convenience, accessibility, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for clients. It operates a 100% open source enterprise middleware platform that enables users to re-compose code or make additions and changes to meet specific requirements over time. It is easy to assemble with and works seamlessly with other components. Also, all of its products are pre-integrated, saving clients time.</p>

<p>The company offers accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its platform enables users to build, integrate, secure, analyze, and manage their APIs, Web services, applications, and microservices—on-premises, on mobile devices, in public or private clouds, and across the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific positive outcomes for clients include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eBay used WSO2’s Enterprise Service Bus to handle the traffic of its growing customer base, resulting in 24x7 customer service availability and the processing of over one billion calls daily</li>
  <li>SUVA used WSO2’s Enterprise Service Bus to implement an integrated Web services platform, enabling it to manage over 100 web services overseeing 2.2 million calls per month</li>

 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has numerous prominent clients, including Cisco, eBay, StubHub, Wipro, and the American Automobile Association.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Training Services – The company provides training in public spaces and also at the client’s site, where it can be personalized to the client’s preferences (data, systems, processes, etc.). Course participants can also enroll in a certification program in order to provide confirmation of their expertise.</p>

<p>Professional Services – The company offers the following professional services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>QuickStart Package – WSO2 places two consultants at the client’s site to conduct a week of agile work so the client’s team can get a project off the ground efficiently.</li>
  <li>Strategic Consultancy Package – WSO2 assists clients with complex projects spanning multiple products that need to be completed in a specified period of time.</li>
  <li>WSO2 Managed Cloud – WSO2 offers this hosted service for all of its products. The service sets up virtual machine (JVM) or containerized environments and tailors the deployment to run any combination of its products according to client need.
 Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. The company’s website features  a “Library“ section that includes useful resources such as articles, white papers, analyst reports, case studies, tutorials, webinars, and videos. The site also provides self-paced training materials, product documentation, answers to frequently asked questions, and access to a monthly e-mail newsletter providing information on middleware news and events.</li>

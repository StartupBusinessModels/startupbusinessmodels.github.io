<p>The Company additionally operates web support portals for its various target industries, through which clients can access a range of online resources.</p>

DST is based in the US, its principal market. It also serves clients across markets in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, notably Canada, Australia, and the UK.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>DST’s key resources are its proprietary technologies and intellectual properties, its solutions and products, its IT and communications infrastructure, its physical office network, its partnerships, and its personnel.</p>

<p>According to its annual report, DST holds a number of US patents, US copyrights and trademarks that various aspects of its information processing and computer software services and products.</p>

<p>Searches of records published by the US Patent and Trademark Office identified several patent applications in which DST was named as assignee, including applications entitled ‘Simultaneous real-time access to financial information’, ‘Graphical user interface (GUI) language translator’ and ‘Simultaneous real-time presentation of financial information’.</p>

<p>DST also owns and or leases a number of physical properties around the world. This principally comprises its network of sales and administration offices across North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>DST incurs costs in relation to the development of its technologies and solutions, the maintenance of its IT and communications infrastructure, the procurement of professional services, the management of its partnerships, the implementation of marketing and advertising campaigns, and the retention of its personnel.

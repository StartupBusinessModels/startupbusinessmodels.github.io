<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Tencent has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at consumers and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Tencent offers three primary value propositions: innovation, risk reduction, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company embraces innovation as part of its culture. More than 50% of its employees work in research and development. Also, it maintains patents for technologies in several areas, including eCommerce, instant messaging, search engine, online payment services, gaming, and information security.</p>

<p>The company reduces risk through high safety and security standards. It uses the following strategies to protect intellectual property on its network of platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reminds visitors to respect IP through user agreements, notifications, and announcements</li>
  <li>Operates an automated monitoring and integrated IP protection system that monitors for infringement around the clock, investigates and gathers evidence of infringement, serves takedown notices, and creates infringement reports</li>
  <li>Proactively deals with infringement through deletion, filtering, and removal of URLs</li>
  <li>Works with law firms across China to document, collect, and preserve evidence of infringement on all prominent Internet and mobile platforms</li>
  <li>Works with other Internet companies, media companies, and intellectual property rights holders to combine strengths to fight infringement</li>
  <li>Maintains a team of dedicated IP enforcement attorneys</li>
  <li>
    <p>Enforces IP rights through a multi-pronged approach that includes administrative actions, civil litigation, industry alliances, and criminal prosecution
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is the largest online services provider in China. Its portfolio features many top properties, including the following:</p>

 Lastly, Tencent has over 700 clients, including many <em>Fortune</em> 500 firms such as Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, IBM, HP Samsung, Intel, Ford, BMW, Toyota, and Nike.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Tencent’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its services through its platforms while having limited interaction with employees. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>It maintains important physical resources in the form of its network of Tencent Research Institute campuses; a research and development center in the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone; and a data and R&amp;D center in Tianjin’s Binhai Service Outsourcing Industry Park. Lastly, it places a high priority on its intellectual property.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Tencent has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation and low-price value propositions. Its biggest cost driver is cost of revenues, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and administration, both fixed costs.</p>

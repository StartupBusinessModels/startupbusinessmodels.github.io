<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>CompuCom has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at firms across industries needing IT products/services.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>CompuCom offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. Over the past 30 years it has acquired several firms with different types of offerings, adding capabilities in everything from technology outsourcing and software application development to government services. This activity has enabled it to greatly expand its portfolio and appeal to a broader range of clients.</p>

<p>The company places a strong emphasis on innovation. It maintains the Innovation Delivery Framework, a program through which it works with clients to target their desired future state, identify necessary changes with a minimal impact on end users, and specify relevant IT solutions.</p>

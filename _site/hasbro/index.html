<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Hasbro’s products are designed for consumption by general consumers, primarily children, who are able to purchase Hasbro products through various channels. While general consumers do make up a direct customer segment of the Company, its principal customers comprise a range of physical and online retailers and distributors, including wholesalers, distributors, chain stores, discount stores, drug stores, mail order houses, catalogue stores, department stores and other traditional retailers both large and small, as well as internet-based ‘e-tailers’.</p>

<p>According to its annual report, the Company makes the majority of its sales to large chain stores, distributors and wholesalers. During 2015, net revenues from derived from Hasbro’s top five customers accounted for approximately 39% of the Company’s consolidated global net revenues. This included revenue generated by sales to its three largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Toys “R” Us, and Target Corporation, which respectively represented 16%, 9% and 9% of net revenues for the year.</p>

<p>The US and Canada comprise Hasbro’s largest market, accounting for a little over half of the Company’s annual revenue. International sales, notably across Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, are also significant.</p>

<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>

<p>Hasbro provides value to its customers in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The quality and breadth of its product offerings, including an extensive range of toys, games, television programming, motion picture content, and digital gaming content;</li>
  <li>Its brand reputation and industry standing, being one of the largest and most well-known companies of its kind worldwide, associated with quality and original content and products;</li>
  <li>Its global sales and marketing reach, with operations across North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, as well as in other jurisdictions; and</li>
  <li>Its high-profile and popular intellectual properties and franchises, including lucrative and popular titles such as Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, Play-Doh and Transformers.
 ### Channels</li>
</ul>

<p>Hasbro operates  website at www.hasbro.com through which customers are able to find information on the Company’s various business activities and services. The Company also operates an online store hosted at the www.hasbrotoyshop.com domain, where general consumers are able to purchase toys and games directly from the Company.</p>

<p>As noted above, the majority of Hasbro’s sales are made to distributors, retailers and resellers. These sales are made by the Company’s own in-house sales teams that are organised by region across the world. Hasbro’s own direct sales force is supported by a network of channel partners that sell the Company’s products in jurisdictions that the Company does not itself maintain a direct presence.</p>

<p>In addition to its physical products, Hasbro licenses its properties for and creates its own television programming, motion picture and digital gaming content, which is distributed through various broadcast networks, digital on-demand platforms such as Netflix and iTunes, and gaming networks.</p>

<p>Hasbro’s sales to distributors and retailers, which comprise the majority of the Company’s business, are made primarily through the Company’s own in-house sales unit. This allows the Company to establish long-standing relationships with larger customers, consulting with clients to provide a tailored service. This approach is apparent in its ongoing relationships with high-profile customers such as Walmart and Toys “R” Us.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>RealPage offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its solutions serve managers and owners of a wide variety of rental property types, including student, military, senior, single-family, and vacation housing. It also offers mixed-use and commercial property management solutions. It is able to provide so many options in part because it has acquired numerous companies since it’s founding. These include AssetEye, NWP Services Corporation, Notivus Multi-Family, Propertyware, eREI, SeniorLiving.Net, MyNewPlace, RentMineOnline, RentSentinel, ActiveBuilding, Kigo, Indatus ICIM, OpsTechnology, and Compliance Depot.</p>

<p>The company offers convenience by making life simpler for customers. It provides an integrated software platform that acts as a single point of access for resident, prospect, and property data. The platform is also an end-to-end offering that enables users to manage almost every process, including pricing, marketing, leasing, screening, purchasing, and accounting.</p>

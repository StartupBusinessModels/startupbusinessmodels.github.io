<p>ITW has a diversified market business model, with customer groups that have very different needs. The company targets its offerings at firms in the automotive, electronics, foodservice, manufacturing, and construction industries.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>ITW offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its products can be found in almost every type of application, ranging from deep-sea oil rigs to bridges and wind turbines to aerospace technology to mobile devices. It is partly able to accomplish this because of the many acquisitions it has made, which have enabled it to add many new capabilities and technologies.</p>

<p>The company embraces innovation as part of its culture. It maintains the proprietary 80/20 business process, which it has practiced for 30 years. Through the process, each ITW division focuses on the 20% of its customers that account for 80% of its revenues and structures the business so that it grows relationships with these essential customers. It uses insights from the relationships to design, develop, and patent new products and components that solve their specific problems. The company believes that the efficiencies obtained from 80/20 deliver strong free operating cash flow, best-in-class operating margins, and differentiated returns on invested capital.</p>

<p>The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is a <em>Fortune</em> 200 firm that generated revenues of $13.4 billion in 2015.It has over 51,000 employees working in 84 divisions in 57 countries, including developed and emerging markets. Its portfolio features several problem brands, including Miller Electric, DUO-FAST fasteners, Foster Refrigerator, and the Wolf Range Company. Lastly , it has won a number of honors, including recognition as the World’s Most Admired Company in the Industrial Machinery category by <em>Fortune</em> in 2016.</p>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>ITW’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. That said, there is a co-creation element. The company works with key clients through its 80/20 process to co-develop innovative new solutions.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

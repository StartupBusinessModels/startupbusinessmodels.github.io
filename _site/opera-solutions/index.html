<h3 id="customer-segments">Customer Segments</h3>

<p>Opera Solutions has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at organizations of all industries and sizes.</p>

<p>That said, it has deep domain expertise in the following industries: Capital Markets, Consumer Banking, Healthcare, Insurance, Media &amp; Entertainment, Private Equity, Retail, Telecommunications, and Travel &amp; Hospitality.</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Opera Solutions offers three primary value propositions: innovation, performance, and brand/status.</p>

<p>The company enables innovation through its solutions. Its Signal Hub platform automatically creates insights called “signals”, which can be reused, shared, and applied to a wide variety of use cases. Machine learning technologies keep the signals accurate, eliminating redundancies and the need to return to raw data for each use case. This in turn leads to a major improvement in productivity. In a nutshell, Opera Solutions’ platform helps businesses deliver data science at scale.</p>

<p>The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific positive outcomes for customers include the following:</p>

  <li>

<h3 id="customer-relationships">Customer Relationships</h3>

<p>Opera Solutions’ customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize its solutions through the main platform while having limited interaction with employees.</p>

<p>The company’s website features a “Knowledge Base” section that includes useful resources such as white papers, articles, product sheets, case studies, newsletters, brochures, infographics, and videos. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.</p>

<h3 id="key-activities">Key Activities</h3>

<p>Opera Solutions’ business model entails maintaining and updating its platform and designing and developing its solutions for its clients.</p>

<h3 id="key-resources">Key Resources</h3>

<p>Opera Solutions’ main resource is its proprietary software platform.</p>

<p>It depends on human resources in the form of the engineers that design and develop its solutions, the sales employees that promote them, and the customer service personnel that provide support.  Lastly, as a startup it has relied heavily on funding from investors, raising $122.2 million from six investors as of September 2016.</p>

<h3 id="cost-structure">Cost Structure</h3>

<p>Opera Solutions has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing expenses, a fixed cost.</p>

<p>Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and administration, also fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

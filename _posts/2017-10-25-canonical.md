Businessmodel of Canonical
---------------------------

### Customer Segments

Canonical has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at businesses and governments.

### Value Proposition

Canonical offers five primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, pricing, performance, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It makes Ubuntu available worldwide through retail channels, most major public clouds, and its network of partners. In addition, the platform runs on several devices, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and TVs.

The company offers convenience by making life simpler for customers. It provides employees to assist with all aspects of Ubuntu management, from design and development to training and certification to support.

The company offers a pricing value proposition. Customers can download, use, and share Ubuntu for free. Moreover, they can try its complementary tool Landscape free for 30 days.

The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. It helped the Penn Manor school district set up a network of 1,700 Ubuntu laptops. In one year, savings on license fees for the computers (as compared to an alternative laptop) amounted to $200 per laptop, a total of $345,000.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It touts Ubuntu as the leading operating system for cloud operations – used by most public cloud workloads, new smart gateways, advanced robots, self-driving c ars, and switches.

Thanks to Canonical’s work with top phone and PC manufacturers, Ubuntu is available on computers sold at more than 3,000 retailers in China, India, and Mexico. All major hardware vendors, software vendors, system integrators and cloud providers have certified their technologies on Ubuntu. Lastly, Canonical has staff members operating in over 30 countries worldwide.

### Channels

Canonical’s main channels are retail channels, major public clouds, and its network of partners. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, and conferences.

### Customer Relationships

Canonical’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company assists customers with its flagship service, Ubuntu Advantage, through which it does the following:

 * Plan and Install – The company builds and installs a solution on trial systems, monitors it, then provides deployment recommendations
* Deploy – The company configures and then deploys the system
* Train – The company trains clients on how to manage their deployments
* Manage – The company works with client teams to monitor and optimize their deployments on an ongoing basis, offering 24/7 phone, e-mail, and portal support
 Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. The company maintains the Canonical Knowledge Base, an online library of articles about technical issues. It is available exclusively to Ubuntu Advantage subscribers. It also offers Landscape, a systems management tool designed to monitor and support networks of desktops, clouds, and servers.

It provides features such as automated updates and deployment of its reference architecture OpenStack cloud. Furthermore, the firm‘s website offers the Ubuntu design blog, with articles written by the Canonical design team.

Lastly, there is a community element in the form of a peer forum where clients can interact.

### Key Activities

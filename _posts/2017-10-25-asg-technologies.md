Businessmodel of ASG Technologies
----------------------------------

### Customer Segments

ASG has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at organizations across industries and sizes.

### Value Proposition

ASG offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, performance, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired several firms since its founding, including NTRglobal, Atempo, RiverGlass, PS’Soft, and Dirig Software. This strategy has enabled it to greatly diversify its portfolio. Consequently, its broad range of capabilities includes Applications Management, Metadata Management, Operations Management, Performance Management, Content Management, Infrastructure Management, and Security Management.

The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific outcomes for individual clients include the following:

 * Baylor Health Care System used ASG’s Cypress solution for its employee and patient reporting processes, resulting in a $500,000 reduction in annual reporting and printing costs
* Opsource used ASG’s Time Navigator solution to back up and archive operations and application data, resulting in the saving of 70% per gigabyte stored and reduced deployment times
* University of Pennsylvania Health System used ASG’s Cypress solution to streamline its network’s printing processes, saving more than $1.5 million per year in printing and archival costs
* Generali used ASG’s Workspaces solution to reduce application delivery costs, enabling it to securely deliver 700 apps to 15,000 employees.
* One of the top five banks in the U.S. used ASG’s Data Intelligence lineage solution to enable migration projects, resulting in over $100,000 in savings and an 80-fold efficiency improvement
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It serves over 4,000 clients, including 70% of the *Fortune *500. Its prominent customers include American Express, Daimler, General Electric, Coca-Cola, IBM, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Lockheed Martin, Procter & Gamble, Verizon, Sony, and Wells Fargo.

### Channels

ASG’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, and participation in webcasts, seminars, summits, and conferences.

### Customer Relationships

ASG’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company assists its customers in the following ways:

Support Services – The company provides general phone, e-mail, and online customer support 24 hours a day, five days a week. It also offers emergency support on a 24x7 basis, with support personnel responding within 30 minutes of an initial call.

 Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. The company’s website features a “Resources“ section that includes white papers, data sheets, case studies, brochures, and compatibility guides.

### Key Activities

ASG’s business model entails designing and developing its software products for customers and delivering related services.

### Key Partners

ASG’s key partners are the firms that sell its products in order to extend its reach, such as integrators. Specific partners include Dell, IBM, Sandhill, Xerox, Teradata, Wipro, and Trillium Software.

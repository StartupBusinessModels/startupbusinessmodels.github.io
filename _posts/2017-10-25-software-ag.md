Businessmodel of Software AG
-----------------------------

### Customer Segments

Software AG has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at businesses of all industries and sizes that want to build their own digital applications.

### Value Proposition

Software AG offers three primary value propositions: performance, innovation, and brand/status.

The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results for clients. High-profile examples of these outcomes include the following:

 * Nissan Europe used Software AG’s Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) technology to evolve its mainframe environment, resulting in overall vehicle inventory reduction of 35% over three years
* Flughafen Zürich AG used Software AG’s webMethods suite to achieve service ROI within one year, generating more than 100,000 CHF in savings
* Cargolux Airlines used Software AG’s ARIS products to find inefficiencies in its organizational processes, in the process identifying 180 areas for improvement
* CERN used Software AG’s BigMemory Max solution to reduce overall system response times, increase throughput, and reduce the number and cost of maintenance repair incidents
* ING used Software AG’s Apama Analytics & Decisions Platform and consulting services to achieve faster initial solution delivery – three months instead of 18 months
 The company places a high priority on innovation. It is heavily involved with Software Innovation for the Digital Enterprise, a program managed by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research that creates partnerships between the business and scientific communities. It also participates in many projects funded by the European Commission for the research of new technologies.

The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It is the second largest software provider in Germany and the seventh largest such firm in Europe. It serves more than 10,000 enterprise customers in more than 70 countries. It claims to have developed the world‘s first end-to-end digital business platform. Lastly, it has won many honors, including recognition as the top vendor in the Streaming Analytics report by Bloor (2016), as a leader in the Big Data Streaming Analytics report by Forrester Research (2016), and as a leader in several Garner Magic Quadrants.

### Channels

Software AG’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, webinars, live online demos, advertising, road shows, and conferences.

### Customer Relationships

Software AG’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company assists customers in the following ways:

Support Services - The company offers the following paid services:

 * Enterprise Active Support – Provides 24/7 phone support, prioritization of incident help requests with 2x faster response times, and a resolution plan within the first four hours
* Enterprise Premium Services – Provides access to Technical Engineers, who offer go-live support, after-business hours support, and operational readiness checks for new customers; Customer Success Managers, single points of contact who provide proactive management of support requests; and Dedicated Engineers, who provide complementary support for existing staff
 Training Services – The company offers comprehensive instructor-led product training through public, on-site classroom, and remote formats, as well as a certification program.

Despite this orientation, there is also a self-service component. The company’s website offers an eLearning program for self-directed learning. It also features a “Resource Center” that includes analyst reports, books, brochures, videos, fact sheets, financial reports, free trial software, tutorials, newsletters, two-minute overviews, webinars, and white papers. Other parts of the site have case studies, product documentation, and answers to frequently asked questions. Lastly, there is a community element in the form of various forums where customers can interact with peers.

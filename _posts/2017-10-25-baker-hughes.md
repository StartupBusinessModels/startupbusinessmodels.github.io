The Company’s sales personnel provide tailored services that suit the individual needs and circumstances of each client, agreeing unique contracts with each customer. While the Company may have contracts with customers that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period ranging from two to four years, its services and products are typically provided on a well-by-well basis.

Baker Hughes provides ongoing support and technical services to its customers, with large clients having their own dedicated account management teams. Baker Hughes provides contact details for its various offices and departments on its website, with prospective and existing clients able to contact the Company directly in order to receive personalised assistance. Additionally, Baker Hughes provides a range of online support resources, including technical papers, case histories, brochures, and data sheets, which can be accessed independently.

Alternatively, Baker Hughes operates a number of social media accounts – including with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube – through which customers are able to interact directly with the Company.

The majority of the Company’s remaining revenue was generated by its Europe, Africa, and Russian Caspian, and Middle East and Asia Pacific segments.

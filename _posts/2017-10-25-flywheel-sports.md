Despite utilising proprietary technology in its exercise equipment to track user performance, searches of records published by the US Patent and Trademark Office identified no patent applications filed in the name of Flywheel Sports.

Flywheel Sports owns and or leases a number of properties across the US and Dubai, principally its network of 40 studios, which are key to the Company’s ongoing operations.

### Revenue Streams

Flywheel Sports generates revenue through the operation of fitness and indoor cycle studios across the US and Dubai. The Company’s revenue is derived from three principal streams:

 * Classes and Packages, comprising revenue derived from the sale of individual classes and packages of classes through the Company’s website and mobile app;
* Memberships, comprising revenue derived from the sale of monthly memberships; and
* Merchandise, comprising the sale of branded merchandise and apparel through the Company’s studio network.

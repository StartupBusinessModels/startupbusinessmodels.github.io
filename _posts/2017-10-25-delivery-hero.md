Delivery Hero’s marketplace offers products from more than 300,000 participating restaurants worldwide, primarily comprising small and medium-sized local businesses that wish to extend their brand reach and expand their customer base.

### Value Propositions

Delivery Hero provides value to its customers through its convenient and easy-to-use marketplace, through which consumers can order food and make payments online. The platform is accessible via mobile and desktop browsers and various mobile apps, allowing users to place orders at their convenience, from their home or on the go, at prices the same or similar to if they had ordered in person.

Consumers are able to browse and place orders from a variety of local restaurants organised within a simple-to-use interface and receive a range of offers and discounts. Delivery Hero’s platform enables participating restaurants to extend their brand reach, secure new customers and increase sales.

### Channels

Delivery Hero’s services can be accessed through its mobile and desktop websites at www.deliveryhero.com, where users can browse menus, manage accounts and place orders. The Company also has iOS and Android apps available to its users, which have the same functionality as the Delivery Hero website.

### Customer Relationships

For consumers, Delivery Hero’s platform is entirely self-service. Users can browse menus from their computer or mobile device, before placing an order and completing payment with no interaction with representatives from Delivery Hero or from the selected restaurant. While users can create an account through the Company’s website or via one of its mobile apps, orders can be placed without registration. After an order is placed, users can contact customer support staff over the phone or via an online chat service.

Restaurants can sign up to be part of the Delivery Hero network through an online form or through direct contact with the Delivery Hero team. The Company operates a number of social media accounts through its various brands and subsidiary companies, including on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. It also keeps registered customers updated with deals and discounts via email.

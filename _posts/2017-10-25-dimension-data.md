 ### Channels

Dimension Data operates a website at www.dimensiondata.com, where customers are able to view and find information on the Company’s services and solutions and business operations. The Company, however, does not operate an online sales channel.

The majority of Dimension Data’s sales are made by its in-house direct sales teams, which are organised on a regional basis. The Company has a presence in all of its operating regions, including offices in the US, Brazil, Australia, the UK, South Africa, and China.

Dimension Data’s sales operations are supported by a network of resellers and independent sales agents that help to extend the Company’s marketing reach.

### Customer Relationships

While Dimension Data operates a website, its products are not available to customers on a self-service basis. The Company’s sales instead are made through its direct sales teams, with customers consulting directly with Company representatives in order to ensure that their individual needs are met. Dimension Data aims to establish long-standing relationships with its customers, with many clients providing recurring business to the Company.

Dimension provides technical support and assistance to clients as part of its full suite of services. It also provides customers with personalised advice and support through an online chat service and telephone assistance, as well as through a portfolio of online learning resources such as user guides and tutorials.

Additionally, customers are able to interact directly with the Company through its social media accounts, including with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

### Cost Structure

Dimension Data incurs costs in relation to the development of its IT solutions, the maintenance of its IT infrastructure, the management of its partnerships, the operation of its sales and distribution channels and the retention of its personnel. The Company’s most significant costs relate to its general operation and administration.

Dimension Data employs a workforce of around 31,000 worldwide, accruing costs in the form of salaries and benefits, and operates a network of offices across 58 countries, representing costs in the form of rent and utilities.

### Revenue Streams

Dimension Data generates revenue through the sale of IT services and solutions, including systems integration, internet solutions, planning, building, support and management services. The Company breaks its revenue down into three streams:

 * Products, including revenue generated by the one-off sale of non-proprietary products;
* Managed Services, including revenue generated by the provision of recurring IT services; and

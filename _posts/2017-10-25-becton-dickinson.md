Becton Dickinson employs a hybrid sales distribution model. Its products are marketed and sold in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels, as well as directly to end-users by Becton Dickinson sales representatives.

While the Company offers some ecommerce solutions to its distributors and resellers, Becton Dickinson products are not typically available on a self-service basis.

Becton Dickinson deals with both distributors and end-users, providing a tailored service to each customer that fulfils their individual requirements. The Company often enters into multi-year contracts, sales-type leases and operating leases with customers. It also provides its customers with extended warranty contracts and software maintenance contracts.

Becton Dickinson continues to provide personal care to its customers after-sale. Customers are able to contact the Company directly, with specific contact details provided for different business units and products ranges, over the phone or via email, in order to receive personalized technical support. This is supplemented by a range of online learning resources included in the Company’s Customer Learning Portal.

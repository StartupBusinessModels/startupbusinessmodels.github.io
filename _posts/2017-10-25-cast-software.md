 ### Channels

Cast operates a website at www.castsoftware.com, through which it provides information on its product and solutions, target customers, partners, and corporate activities. The Company does not operate an online sales channel; however, it does offer customers a tool through which they can arrange a demonstration of the Company’s software. Once purchased, customers are able to access the platform on computers where the software is installed.

Cast makes its sales through a direct sales force which operates out of the Company’s international network of offices. This includes sales offices in Brussels, Munich, Madrid, Milan, Bangalore, London, and Washington DC. While Cast has a direct sales presence across the US, India, and much of Europe, the Company makes its sales in other jurisdictions through authorised representatives, including Kalitek in the middle East and Africa, Solupia in South Korea, and Extramile Technologies in Romania.

### Customer Relationships

Cast does not make sales of its products and solutions to customers on a self-service basis. Customers can arrange a demonstration of the Company’s platform online, but must make purchases through the Company’s in-house sales force. Once purchased, the Company’s software can be used independently by clients.

Cast makes its sales directly, consulting closely with clients in order to fully understand and fulfil their individual needs, and providing demonstrations and tutorials of how best to implement its products. The Company’s products appear to be provided under sales contracts agreed on a case-by-case basis, with solutions tailored to each client’s individual circumstances.

Cast provides ongoing support to its clients, providing customers with contact detail for technical support teams across its various office locations, allowing clients to access personalised responses to queries and technical concerns. The company also provides a range of online resources, such as troubleshooting guides, articles, and training materials, and hosts a customer community portal, through which users can interact with one another and collaborate on problems.

Additionally, Cast operates a number of social media accounts – including with Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, and LinkedIn – through which it can provide company updates and interact directly with clients.

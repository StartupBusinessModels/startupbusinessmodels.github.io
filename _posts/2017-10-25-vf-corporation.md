### Value Proposition

VF Corporation offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It offers brands in a broad range of categories, including outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack, luggage, accessory, sportswear, occupational, and performance apparel.

The company places a strong emphasis on innovation. It maintains the VF Innovation Fund, which provides financial support for innovative projects proposed by its employees. It also works with leading neuroscientists to understand how the brain sees, and uses this knowledge to improve its products, marketing, and merchandising.

The company promotes its offering through its social media pages, advertising (TV/radio/online/consumer and trade publications), sponsorship of sports, musical, and special events, and the offering of rebate and coupon offers to customers.

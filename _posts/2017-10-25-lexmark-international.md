Businessmodel of Lexmark International
---------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Both Lexmark International’s laser printing and imaging products and enterprise software solutions are targeted primarily at business customers. The Company serves business across multiple sectors, including the healthcare, financial services and insurance industries. A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is also derived from contracts with the US federal, state and local governments, as well as international governments and agencies.

Lexmark International’s native US remains its largest single market; however, the majority of the Company’s sales come from its international customers. Around 35% of the Company’s international sales come from within Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Lexmark International also sells products and services across North and South America, Asia, the Pacific Rim and the Caribbean.

### Value Propositions

Lexmark provides value to its customers in the form of quality, dependable physical products and efficient and versatile enterprise software solutions.

The Company’s commitment to innovation and development helps to maintain this value, retain existing customers and attract new clients.

Lexmark provides a wealth of free learning and technical support resources to its customers, and allows customers to interact with one another through its community forum.

The quality of Lexmark’s products and services is enhanced through the Company’s collaboration with companies from a range of sector and jurisdictions, notably strategic alliances with high-profile companies associated with quality, including Microsoft, Canon and SAP.

### Channels

Lexmark International’s portfolio of software solutions and laser printing hardware can be viewed on the Company’s website at www.lexmark.com. Products, however, cannot be purchased from the Company online, instead customers must contact members of the Lexmark International sales team.

Lexmark International also collaborates with a network of resellers that are authorised to sell the Company’s products either online or in physical stores.

### Customer Relationships

While Lexmark International’s products and services can be viewed online, they are not available on a self-service basis. In order to make a purchase, customers must contact one of Lexmark’s international sales teams directly, or request for a sales representative to contact them, in order for the Company to more accurately fulfil the individual needs of each client.

Lexmark International also provides personalised technical support to its customers both online and over the phone, in addition to making a range of learning, training and troubleshooting resources available on its website.

The Company interacts with its customers directly, keeping them updated with company developments, through its news section, blog, newsletter and social media accounts, including with Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. The Lexmark International website also hosts a community forum for users of its enterprise software products.

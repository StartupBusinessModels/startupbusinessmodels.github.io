Businessmodel of VaynerMedia
-----------------------------

### Customer Segments

VaynerMedia has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes.

### Value Proposition

VaynerMedia offers four primary value propositions: convenience, accessibility, performance, and brand/status.

The company offers convenience by making operations simpler for clients. It provides a full-service solution that advises clients on everything from content creation to production to publishing to analytics. It conducts a top-to-bottom evaluation of all of a client’s social channels, an evaluation that addresses customers’ true preferences, competitors’ statuses, and areas of opportunity.

The company creates accessibility by making it easy for clients to work with prominent social platforms. It works hard to develop and maintain close relationships with sites such as Facebook Twitter, and YouTube, which enables it to optimize every new update that is rolled out.

The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results for its clients. For example, it worked with Twitter to build tailored tools to increase positive conversation around the campaign of one of its customers, Dove. The effort resulted in a 25% decrease in negative tweets.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It maintains offices in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Chattanooga, and has over 450 employees. It works with 90 brands, ranging from sports teams to consumer packaged goods firms to TV networks. These include many *Fortune* 500 companies such as PepsiCo, General Electric, Anheuser-Busch, JP Morgan Chase, and Mondelez. Lastly, it has won a number of honors, including a Shorty Award for Best Large Agency (2014), Webby Awards for Best Use of Native Advertising and Best Use of Video, and recognition as one of Advertising Age’s Agencies to Watch, Agency Standouts, and A-List Agencies.

This allows the Company, where possible, to tailor and scale its solutions to ensure that each customer receives appropriate services for their size and activities. The Company seeks to establish its cloud-based offerings as a key component of its clients’s internal systems, ensuring long-term customer relationships.

PCC offers ongoing support to its clients, who are able to contact dedicated support personnel over the phone or via an online contact form in order to access personalised assistance.

### Revenue Streams

Schoology’s enterprise package, aimed at companies and institutions, appears to be its main revenue stream.

However, the Company does not disclose its pricing model on its website nor does it publicly disclose its financial results. Research suggests that the Company’s paid-for enterprise solution appears to be negotiated directly with Company representatives. Some internet sources suggest that the enterprise package is priced at $10 per user as a one-time fee.

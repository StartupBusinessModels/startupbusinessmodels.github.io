Businessmodel of Bemis Company
-------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Bemis has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offering at all industries that require packaging products.

That said, most of its clients are in the food industry, with the remainder primarily operating in the personal care, medical, pharmaceutical, chemical, agribusiness, construction, and electronics sectors.

### Value Proposition

Bemis Company offers five primary value propositions: convenience, risk reduction, accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.

The company offers convenience by making life simpler for customers. Its packaging facilitates easier opening and reclosing of containers, as well as portioning of their contents.

The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality and safety standards. Its packaging features an oxygen and moisture barrier that combats bacteria and optimizes product freshness. This in turn reduces food spoilage, increasing safety and reducing food waste. For pharmaceutical and medical applications, the packaging provides sterility as necessary.

The company creates accessibility by presenting a wide variety of options. It has acquired numerous companies since its founding. In the past three years alone, it has purchased Foshan New Changsheng Plastics Films and the packaging operations of SteriPack and Emplal Participações S.A. These actions have enabled it to diversify its portfolio of offerings and expand its capabilities.

The company places a strong emphasis on innovation. It operates the Bemis Innovation Center, a facility designed to move packaging ideas from the concept to the commercialization stage more quickly. Specific activities include rapid prototyping, hands-on research, and collaboration. The center also enables customers to test out how the company’s packaging affects their products inside and outside of the store environment. Specific activities here include shelf-life testing, product evaluation/trials, focus groups, consumer eye-tracking, and collaborative team sessions.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It bills itself as the largest flexible packaging company in the Americas, with revenues of $4.1 billion in 2015 and 18,000 employees worldwide. It has won a number of honors, including the following:

 * The Highest Achievement Award for the Campbell’s Ready Meals pouch from the Flexible Packaging Association (2016)
* A Diamond Finalist Award for the Doril Enxaqueca medicine package, given by Dupont for Responsible Packaging, Technological Advancement, and Enhanced User Experience (2016)
 ### Channels

Bemis Company’s main channel is its direct sales team, which operates through offices located in North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific. It also utilizes some additional unspecified distribution channels. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, and participation in trade shows and conferences.

### Customer Relationships

Bemis Company’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.

### Key Activities

 * Residential and Religious, comprising general consumers – including single-family dwellings and individual apartments in multi-family dwellings – religious organisations such as churches, and certain other non-profit organisations.
* Commercial and Industrial, comprising commercial and industrial entities across multiple business sectors;

 Con Edison exclusively serves customers in the US. The Company’s utility services are limited primarily to customers based in New York, northern New Jersey, northeastern Pennsylvania, and Westchester County.

### Value Propositions

Con Edison provides value to its customers in the following ways:

 * Its reputation and industry standing, with the Company being one of the largest investor-owned energy companies in the US, including a number of commercial customers and public bodies among its customers;
* The reliability and efficiency of its utility services, with the Company having a track-record of reliably providing electricity, gas and steam to customers across areas of the US;

 ### Channels

Con Edison operates a website at www.coned.com, through which it provides customers with information on its services, business activities and tariffs. Customers are also able to manage their accounts through the Company’s website and pay utility bills directly. This functionality is also available through the Con Edison mobile app. The Company, however, does no operate an online sales channel.

Con Edison makes its sales through an in-house direct sales force, which customers are able to contact over the phone. It operates its own distribution channels and transmission facilities, which interconnect with those of the National Grid, Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, Orange and Rockland Utilities, New York State Electric and Gas, Connecticut Light and Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, the New York Power Authority, and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.

Con Edison does not sell products to customers on a self-service basis; however, customers are able to manage their accounts and pay utility bills on a self-service basis through the Company’s website, without interacting with any Con Edison sales representatives.

Con Edison makes sales through its direct sales team, consulting with customers and agreeing fixed-term service contracts. The Company aims to establish long-term relationships with customers.

Con Edison provides ongoing support to its customers, who are able to contact customer service representatives over the phone, via email, and through the postal service. The Company also operates customer service walk-in centres where customers can receive personalised, in-person assistance.

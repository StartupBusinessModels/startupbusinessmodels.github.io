Steel Dynamics operates its own network of processing facilities and electric arc furnace steel mills, through which it produces its products, as well as its own distribution centres and logistics infrastructure.

Steel Dynamics provides ongoing support to its customers, including FAQs, news articles, scrap specifications, and product details. Customers are also able to contact members of the Company’s support personnel over the phone and via email, and receive a personalised response to queries and complaints.

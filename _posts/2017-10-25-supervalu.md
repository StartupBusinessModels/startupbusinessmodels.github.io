---------------------------

### Customer Segments

SuperValu has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at consumers and at retailers.

### Value Proposition

SuperValu offers three primary value propositions: pricing, innovation, and brand/status.

The company offers a pricing value proposition. It operates a private brand program through which it sells value-priced alternatives to major national brands. The program’s selection includes over 5,000 foods and general merchandise items, ranging from flour and sugar to meats and specialty items.

The company has embraced innovation throughout its history. Its groundbreaking efforts include:

 * Building the first modern grocery warehouse in Minneapolis
* Becoming the first distribution company to use motorized trucks for deliveries
* Building a chute that enables products to move between floors without the use of elevators
* Using computer technology to streamline warehouse inventory monitoring, retail order processing, truck dispatching, and accepting of manufacturer shipments
* Launching SVHarbor, an Internet-enabled business-to-business portal for affiliated and corporate retailers, manufacturer partners, and distribution centers
* Building the East View Innovation Center on its home office campus, a facility that includes state-of-the-art test kitchens, sensory laboratories, and grocery store department prototypes
 The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. It is the fifth-largest food retailing chain in the U.S., following Kroger and Albertsons.

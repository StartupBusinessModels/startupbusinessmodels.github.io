 ### Channels

### Customer Relationships

Jabil’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products and services while having limited interaction with employees.

The company’s website features an “Expertise Hub” that includes self-help resources such as articles, blogs, case studies, brochures, fact sheets, eBooks, white papers, infographics, and videos.

It also includes a customer portal called “Jabil Business Connect” where clients can collaborate with the firm on content and access a document library. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.

### Key Activities

Jabil’s business model entails designing, developing, and manufacturing its offerings for clients.

### Key Partners

Jabil’s key partners are the suppliers of the parts and components it needs to manufacture products.

The company also forms manufacturing and supply chain partnerships with other firms to enhance its offerings, and educational partnerships with universities for research and innovation purposes.

A high-profile example is its alliance with the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering in Jena, Germany, with whom it is working to improve camera lens technology.

### Key Resources

Jabil’s main resources are its human resources, primarily the engineering employees who design and develop its solutions and the manufacturing workers that produce them.

It also depends on its physical resources, namely the 90 production plants it operates in 23 different countries, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Scotland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine, the U.S. and Vietnam.

### Cost Structure

Jabil has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation.

Its biggest cost driver is cost of revenues, a variable expense that includes the cost of electronic components and other materials; the cost of manufacturing overhead and labor; and adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory.

Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/administration and research/development, both fixed costs.

### Revenue Streams

Jabil has two revenue streams – revenue from services (manufacturing services associated with electronic equipment built to customer specifications, and design services) and revenue from sales of excess inventory.

Businessmodel of SS&C Technologies
-----------------------------------

### Customer Segments

SS&C has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at vertical markets in the financial services sector, including banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, investment management firms, registered investment advisors, wealth managers, and alternative investment funds. In 2015, its top 10 clients accounted for 14% of total revenues.

### Value Proposition

SS&C offers two primary value propositions: accessibility and brand/status.

The company offers accessibility through the diversity of its offerings. Since 1995, it has acquired 43 organizations with products and services in complementary markets. These acquisitions enabled it to add numerous capabilities to its portfolio; examples include Citi Hedge Fund Services, Prime Management Limited (enabling entry into the Insurance Linked Securities Administration Market), and DST Global Solutions (enabling expansion of its investment management software and services).

The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It offers more than 90 products and services to over 10,000 clients, and operates from 73 offices. It has also won many honors, including an HFM Award for Best Administrator – Technology (2016), a CTA Intelligence Award for Best Client Service (2016), a Waters Rankings Award for Best Accounting System Provider (2015), and recognition by *Forbes* as one of the “Most Innovative Growth Companies” (2015).

### Channels

SS&C’s main channel is its direct sales team, located in numerous offices worldwide. It also uses telemarketing employees to enhance sales of its real estate property management offerings, and collaborates with alliance partners that sell its software services to banking clients.

The company promotes its solutions through its website, product-focused webinars, e-marketing campaigns, eBriefings mailed to prospective customers, participation in symposiums and seminars, and attendance of trade shows and conferences.

### Customer Relationships

SS&C’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products and services while having limited interaction with employees.

It also has a client portal through which users can read release notes and obtain the latest in technical knowledge. That said, there is also a personal assistance component in the form of 24/7 phone, e-mail, and online support.

Businessmodel of ClearSlide
----------------------------

### Customer Segments

ClearSlide serves two customer segments with slightly varying needs:  Individuals to whom it offers “Pro” and “Group” packages, and Businesses to whom it offers “Enterprise” and “Ultimate” packages. Despite this segmentation its CEO indicates that it is most heavily focused on its enterprise users.

### Value Proposition

ClearSlide offers three primary value propositions: convenience, performance, and brand/status.

The company’s product simplifies sales team presentations to prospects by offering a variety of communication formats, including email plugins and alerts, mobile apps, web-based presentations, and cross-company sales content. This wide mix allows team members to be more productive.

The company’s product enables sales leaders to gain insight into the success of a team presentation in progress by providing real-time analytics and visibility. Specific information obtained includes the type of content that is most effective with audiences, and when exactly a prospect opened a presentation. This knowledge helps leaders to improve presentations, which in turns enhances team performance and increases customer engagement, making a sale more likely.

Lastly, ClearSlide has gained a positive reputation in the sales technology space due to its many client success stories, which are posted on its website. Case studies listed include The Economist, BuzzFeed, Shazam, LexisNexis, and Starwood Hotels and Restaurants.

### Channels

ClearSlide’s main channel is its website, through which it promotes its services. It also markets its offerings through the frequent hosting of live webinars.

In addition, the company encourages interested parties to contact it via phone, e-mail, or social media.

### Customer Relationships

ClearSlide’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. In addition to its 24/7 e-mail, phone, and social network support options, the company offers consultation services and training and learning services. These are available via phone, online, or in-person.

That said, there is also a strong self-service component – ClearSlide’s website has a “Resources” section featuring guides, webinars, white papers, case studies, and videos that customers can use to help themselves.

### Key Activities

ClearSlide’s staff manufactures its software and then works to acquire customers for the purchase of its products.

### Key Partners

ClearSlide is partnered with the American Association of Inside Sales Professionals (AA-ISP). The company is a Platinum Underwriter for the organization, which has more than 10,000 individual members representing more than 3,000 companies in the United States and globally.

As part of its role, it co-sponsors conferences held throughout the year, where its duties include giving presentations, participating in panel discussions, and providing general administrative support.

### Key Resources

ClearSlide’s main resource is its proprietary software system. It also depends heavily on its human resources, particularly its sales team, which is spread across three offices, and its technology team, which features many different types of developers.

As a relatively new start-up, ClearSlide also relies on the group of investors through which it has raised millions in funding.

### Cost Structure

ClearSlide has a value-driven structure, offering value through significant personal assistance. Its biggest cost drivers are sales/marketing and product development expenses, both fixed costs; sales and technology employees represent its biggest teams, each accounting for 40% of its workforce. Another major expense driver is customer support/operations expenses.

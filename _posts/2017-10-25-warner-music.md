* Digital download services, such as iTunes and Google Play; and

 Warner Music provides its services and content to customers across the world. Its principal market, however, is its native US. The Company also serves markets across Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.

### Value Propositions

Warner Music provides value to its customers in the following ways:

 * The quality and breadth of its content, with the Company owning the rights to a wide range of music content across numerous genres, and from high-profile artists both current and historic, such as Ed Sheeran, The Eagles, Van Morrison, Wiz Khalifa, The Kinks and Skrillex;

 ### Channels

Warner Music operates a website at www.wmg.com, through which it provides information on its various services and its music content portfolio. The Company does not make its content available through its own digital sales channels.

Warner Music’s physical products – including CDs, DVDs, and LPs – are sold directly to retail and distribution customers by its own in-house sales force, from a network of sales offices across its operating jurisdictions. The Company has a presence in more than 50 countries worldwide, either directly or via subsidiary companies, affiliates or non-affiliated licensees.

Warner Music’s content is also available through a range of digital stores and online streaming services. Digital sales and streaming agreements are also covered by the Company’s own sales and business development teams.

### Customer Relationships

Despite its online presence, Warner does not provide content or services to its customers on a self-service basis. Its music content is available to consumer, however, on a self-service basis from various retail outlets, digital stores and streaming services.

Warner Music establishes its sales agreements with retail chains, distributors and wholesalers through direct consultation between its sales team and the customer. The Company seeks to establish long-term relationships with these clients that separately cover the needs and of each individual client. Agreements with online and mobile service providers typically last one to three years. These shorter agreements enable the Company to maintain some flexibility in its dealings with the fast-paced digital business space.

Warner music provides a range of information resources on its website, including FAQs and provides contact details for new and existing customers to contact the company directly. Customers can also interact directly with the Company through its social media accounts with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

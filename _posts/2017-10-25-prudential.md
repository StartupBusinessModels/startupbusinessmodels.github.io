Businessmodel of Prudential
----------------------------

### Customer Segments

Prudential has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have different needs. The company targets its offerings at retail (individual) and institutional customers.

### Value Proposition

Prudential offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, risk reduction, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It offers a broad range of financial products and services, including life insurance, mutual funds, annuities, investment management, and retirement-related services. Its ability to do so is partly due to the fact that it has acquired numerous firms since its founding, including Bache & Co., American Skandia, AIG Edison, AIG Star, the retirement branch of CIGNA Corporation, and the individual life insurance business of The Hartford. This strategy has enabled it to greatly diversify its portfolio.

The company has reduced risk by maintaining high safety and security standards. Its specific actions include the following:

 * Maintaining an official code of conduct that instructs staffers to adhere to ethical behavior
* Requiring new employees to take an ethics course and affirm their commitment
* Providing regular training and education on ethical standards and compliance
* Requiring employees to disclose any perceived or potential conflicts of interest
* Operating Global Business Ethics & Integrity, an enterprise ethics office that oversees Prudential's business ethics programs around the world
* Encouraging employees to communicate with local ethics officers or call a hotline for guidance
 The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. It is the second largest life insurance firm in the U.S., the fourth largest seller of individual life insurance in the U.S., and the ninth largest institutional asset manager globally. It manages over $1.3 trillion in assets and $3.5 trillion in life insurance policies. It maintains offices in 47 countries and territories across North America, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the following:

 * Recognition as one of the “Most Admired Companies in the World“ by *Fortune*
* Recognition as one of one of the “Top Money Managers” by *Pension & Investments*
* Recognition as a “Best Place to Work“ by the Human Rights Campaign
* Recognition as a "Best for Vets Employer" by *Military Times* magazine seven years in a row

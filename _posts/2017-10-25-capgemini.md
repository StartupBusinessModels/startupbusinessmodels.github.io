Businessmodel of Capgemini
---------------------------

### Customer Segments

Capgemini has a mass market business model, with little differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at organizations of all types seeking consulting, technology, and outsourcing services. That said, it is noted for its expertise in the public sector and the utilities, financial services, consumer products, retail, and telecommunications industries.

### Value Proposition

Capgemini offers two primary value propositions: performance and brand/status.

The company has demonstrated strong performance. It maintains a program called Accelerated Solutions Environment (ASE) that has been used by over a third of FTSE 100 and *Fortune* 500 firms. The purpose of the initiative is to gather key stakeholders from different functions within a given organization so they can work together to come up with creative solutions. This activity occurs in events lasting one to three days, hosted by an Accenture ASE facilitation team. The program has generated many specific positive outcomes, including the following:

 * A *Fortune *500 firm reduced more than $4 billion in procurement spending
* A fashion company integrated an end-to-end operations planning and sales process
* An international telecommunications provider identified five new "blockbuster" products
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its performance. It is one of the world’s largest consulting firms with 180,000 employees in more than 40 countries, and 2015 revenues of €11.9 billion. In addition, it has won many honors, including the following:

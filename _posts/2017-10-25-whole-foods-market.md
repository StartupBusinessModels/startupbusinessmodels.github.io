Businessmodel of Whole Foods Market
------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Whole Foods serves a range of consumer demographics across local communities in the US, through its network of supermarket outlets.

Whole Foods typically attracts customers that are more affluent, with an interest in eating healthy and sustainable foods, and do not mind spending extra money to purchase organic and fair trade products. Recent reports suggest that a typical Whole Foods customer is a female between the ages of 25 and 39 with more than $1,000 in discretionary monthly income, typically working in a professional environment.

Whole Foods has recently attempted to diversify its customer base and compete with low-cost grocery chains such as Aldi and Trader Joe’s by launching its own chain of discount outlets. These lower price stores will principally target millennials, who are also typically interested in eating healthily and sustainably but have less disposable income.

The US continues to be Whole Foods’s principal market, accounting for more than 96% of the Company’s sales in 2015. The Company’s remaining sales are shared between Canada and the UK.

### Value Propositions

Whole Foods provides value to its customers in the following ways:

 * Its brand name and industry standing, with the Company established as one of the most popular grocery chains in the US, with its name bringing with it a certain prestige as it is associated with more affluent shoppers;
* Its diverse catalogue of premium products, with the Company offering a broad range of high-quality products and produce, including packaged goods, frozen food, dairy, meat, bakery products, prepared foods, beverages, body care, pet foods, and household goods;
* Its commitment to organic and sustainable sourcing, with the Company dedicated to sourcing organic and high-quality produce from sustainable growers and producers, and participating in sustainability projects;

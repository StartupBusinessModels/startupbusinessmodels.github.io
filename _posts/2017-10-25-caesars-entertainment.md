Businessmodel of Caesars Entertainment
---------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Caesars Entertainment principally provides gaming and gambling services to the general consumer population. The nature of the Company’s core services limits the Company’s customer demographics to those over the age of 21.

Caesars Entertainment’s casino properties are principally located in tourist hubs Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Consequently, a large portion of the Company’s customers are tourists, both international and domestic. Recent reports suggest that tourism is becoming a key source of revenue for the Company, with its customers spending the majority of funds on non-gaming entertainment, lodging and dining experiences. Reports suggest that older customers continue to be attracted by the Company’s gambling and gaming services, while younger customers are attracted by the Company’s high-end restaurants and brand-name shopping, such as that offered by its LINQ promenade.

Caesars Entertainment principally serves the US market, with its properties located in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Laughlin, New Orleans, and Baltimore.

 * Casino operations, including revenue derived from slot machines, and table games, as well as games such as keno, poker, and race and sports books;
* Food and beverage operations, including revenue derived from the sale of food and drinks at its restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and lounges;
* Rooms and hotel operations, including revenue derived from hotel stays at its casino properties; and

 In 2015 Caesars Entertainment generated net revenue for the year of $4.65 billion, down considerably on the $8.52 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. This was attributed to the deconsolidation of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company form the Company’s financial results.

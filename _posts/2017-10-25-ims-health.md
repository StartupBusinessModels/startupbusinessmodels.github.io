Businessmodel of IMS Health
----------------------------

### Customer Segments

IMS Health provides information and technology services to organisations operating within the healthcare sector. Its customer base comprises a broad range of companies within the sector, with around 90% of its sales coming from:

 * life science companies;
* pharmaceutical groups;
* biotechnology firms;
* consumer health providers;
* medical device manufacturers;
* diagnostic companies;
 According to the Company’s annual report, it includes almost all of the top 100 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, measured by revenue, among its clients, many of which subscribe to products and services across multiple jurisdictions. IMS Health also serves medical product distributors, government and regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical distributors, financial services firms, and pharmacies. Sales to government agencies represent only around 1% of the Company’s business.

IMS Health’s largest market is its native US, which accounted for around 39% of the Company’s 2015 revenue. The Company, however, also serves customers across more than 100 countries worldwide, with business in emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia growing significantly in recent years.

### Value Propositions

IMS Health provides value to its customers in the following ways:

 * Its industry standing and brand identity, being one of the largest companies in its sector and having a number of longstanding client relationships with high-profile customers;
* The quality and efficiency of its products and services, comprising a diverse suite of solutions developed by in-house experts with the support of market-leading technology partners;
* Its flexible and scalable products and solutions, which can be implemented across businesses of all sizes and in various jurisdictions; and
* Its commitment to innovation, with the Company devoting substantial resources to research and development activities each year.
 ### Channels

IMS Health operates a website at www.imshealth.com, where customers are able to find information on the Company’s services and solutions. The Company, however, does not appear to operate an online sales channel.

The majority of IMS Health’s sales are made directly via its in-house sales teams, which are organised by jurisdiction, managing sales and customer relationships on a local basis. The Company has a sales presence across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia, including offices in Buenos Aires, Caracas, Los Ruices, Lisbon, and Bangalore

IMS Health also sells a portion of its products and solutions to distributors, which sell on to end-users, and collaborates with a network of other channel partners.

### Customer Relationships

While the Company has an online presence, it does not appear to provide services and solutions on a self-service basis. Instead, the Company implements a predominantly direct sales model, with customers consulting directly with members of the Company’s local sales teams before making purchases. This allows the Company to provide a more personalised service that fully covers the client’s brief.

IMS Health maintains long-standing relationships and high renewal rates with its clients, due in part to the nature of the services and solutions its provides. According to its annual report, the average length of relationships with its top 25 clients, as measured by revenue, is over 25 years and its retention rate for its top 1,000 clients from 2014 to 2015 was 99%.

Customers are able to contact IMS Health directly through its website, as well as over the phone, receiving personal care for any issues and enquiries. The Company also operates Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn accounts, through which customers are able to interact directly with IMS Health.

Businessmodel of American Electric Power (AEP)
-----------------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

AEP has a segmented market business model, with customers that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at retail and wholesale customers.

### Value Proposition

American Electric Power offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired numerous firms since its founding, including Indiana and Michigan Electric, Appalachian Power Company, Indiana Service Corporation of Fort Wayne, Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company, and Central and South West Corporation. This strategy has enabled it to greatly diversify its portfolio.

The company has embraced innovation throughout its history. Its industry firsts include:

 * First long-distance transmission line connecting a mine-mouth power plant with a major load center
* First application of carrier-current telephony to transmission lines for system dispatching
* First use of automatic frequency and tie-line load control
* First ultra-high-speed (one cycle or 1/60th of a second), high-voltage reclosing circuit breaker
* First sleet melting of transmission line
* First use of “open loop” shield wire design with gapped insulators on EHV lines to reduce power losses
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is one of the largest electric utility firms in the U.S., serving almost 5.4 million customers in 11 states. It has a service territory of over 200,000 square miles and owns the largest electricity transmission network in the U.S. -- more than 40,000 miles.

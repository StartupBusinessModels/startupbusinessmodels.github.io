-----------------------------------

### Customer Segments

The company targets its offerings at firms across industries that seek easier ways to identify suitable markets and generate new ideas. It serves over 30 industries.

### Value Proposition

NetBase offers three primary value propositions: convenience, performance, and brand/status.

The company’s solution offers convenience by making searching easier. It scours the Web for information of interest, with its language processing technology reading millions of social media posts in 42 languages. It indexes 50,000 sentences per minute from sources such as Twitter and Tumblr. It also provides real-time insights on emotions, attitudes, and purchase behavior.

The company’s solution has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Independent studies have shown it operates as much as nine times faster than comparable offerings from competitors, and is 50 – 70% more accurate. High-profile examples of positive outcomes include the following:

It has a large global presence, working with clients from over 30 industries in more than 99 countries. It has many customers in the *Fortune* 500, including Coca-Cola, Target, T-Mobile, MetLife, and United Airlines.

### Channels

NetBase’s main channel is its direct sales team, though it also utilizes independent software vendors, particularly for countries outside the U.S. and Europe. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, webinars, and participation in forums and conferences.

### Customer Relationships

NetBase’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize the service through the main platform while having limited interaction with employees.

The company’s website features a “Resources” section that includes self-help tools such as white papers, research reports, eBooks, product sheets, webinars, and videos. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.

### Key Activities

NetBase’s business model entails maintaining a robust platform for its customers.

### Key Partners

It depends on its human resources in the form of technology employees to maintain and update the platform, sales staff to promote it, and customer service staff to provide support.

Lastly, as a startup it has relied heavily on funding from outside parties, raising $84.6 million from seven investors as of April 2015.

### Cost Structure

Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing, a fixed expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and product development, also fixed costs.

### Revenue Streams

NetBase has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from the subscription fees it charges for access to its software-as-a-service platform. Sales staff must be contacted directly for pricing quotes.

Businessmodel of ServiceNow
----------------------------

### Customer Segments

ServiceNow has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at large enterprise organizations that need an IT services management solution. Its customers include those in the financial services, IT services, consumer products, technology, and healthcare industries.

### Value Proposition

ServiceNow offers four primary value propositions: convenience, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.

The company’s solution offers convenience by providing a single system of record. It reports infrastructure and service events across numerous IT systems and monitoring tools, making it easier for users to identify and fix problems and restore services more rapidly. Also, the solution is delivered via a cloud platform, allowing customers to quickly deploy and easily configure applications.

The company has demonstrated strong performance. Its solution can process billions of transactions on a monthly basis and manage several petabytes of data while optimizing processing time for transactions. It has also produced many positive outcomes for individual clients. High-profile examples include the following:

 * Cars.com used the solution to save its HR department more than 300 hours a year in onboarding processes and enable its IT department to handle 60% more service request tickets a month
* H&R Block Canada used the solution to manage customer service more effectively, improving its Net Promoter Score (NPS) by 12 points
* Swiss Re used the solution to replace 20 separate legacy applications – streamlining its operations and improving service delivery across the organization
* Gatwick Airport used the solution to optimize service delivery, reducing operating costs by 15%
* Zillow used the solution to solve problems quicker, reducing thousands of events to less than 100
 The company reduces risk by operating a single-instance architecture (most cloud providers operate multi-tenant environments on shared infrastructure databases and servers). Customers have their own database and application processes, which lessens the likelihood of infrastructure outages.

The company has established a strong brand due to its performance. It has over 3,000 enterprise clients, including over 30% of the *Forbes* Global 2000. It is also listed on the Russell 3000 index.

### Channels

ServiceNow’s main channel is its direct sales team, which was responsible for 89% of its revenues in 2015. It also sells its offerings through resale partners, managed service providers, and systems integrators, especially in less developed regions. The company promotes its solution through its website, social media pages, online advertising, webinars, seminars, attendance of trade shows/other industry events, and the annual “Knowledge” user conference that it hosts.

LivingSocial recently laid off around 280 employees in a bid to reduce costs. These layoffs accounted for between 50% and 60% of the Company’s workforce, which now numbers 200 to 225 employees. LivingSocial has reportedly cut almost 900 jobs since Thakar took over as Chief Executive Officer in 2014.

The Company also operates a network of regional offices which accrue costs in the form of rent and utilities.

### Revenue Streams

LivingSocial generates revenue primarily through the sale of vouchers, products and experiences listed on its website. For each sale the Company takes a commission, described by the Company as a marketing fee. The size of these commissions varies from deal to deal, with marketing fee thresholds negotiated with sales representatives directly.

Comments from LivingSocial customers across the internet cite commission rates of between 20% and 50%, with the average rate appearing to be around 30% to 35% of each sale. Merchants receive their share of revenue generated by their products once LivingSocial has deducted its marketing fee. For fiscal year 2014 the Company generated a total of $231 million.

LivingSocial’s secondary revenue stream is advertising. The Company provides a range of advertising solutions to brand marketers and advertising agencies that are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis.

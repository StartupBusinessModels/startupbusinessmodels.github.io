Businessmodel of Apteligent
----------------------------

### Customer Segments

Apteligent serves a range of companies that wish to gain greater insight into the performance of their mobile apps. On its website the Company claims to provide services covering 23,000 apps worldwide.

This includes customers operating in the retail, entertainment, gaming, media, finance, telecommunications, hospitality and technology sectors.

The Company includes a number of household names among its customers, such as Bloomberg, AT&T, Bank of America, Ebay, Microsoft, Nokia and Marriott.

### Value Propositions

Apteligent’s principal value is in its software platform, which purports to improve the efficiency, reliability and profitability of its customers’ applications.

The Company’s software provides accurate, real-time insights that can be used to monitor and identify issues before they are realised. Apteligent offers a range of subscriptions, including fully negotiable enterprise packages for its biggest clients.

The Company’s products are easy to access, with users up and running within minutes, and allow for customised integrated solutions, enabling customers to merge Apteligent functionality into their existing infrastructure.

### Channels

Subscriptions to Apteligent’s performance analytics platform can be purchased from the Company’s website at www.apteligent.com, on desktop or mobile browsers. The software can then be accessed directly via the Company’s website.

Larger enterprise customers can negotiate a quote with members of the Apteligent sales team, who can be reached either online through the Company’s website or over the phone.

The Company’s services can also be integrated into existing applications and infrastructures to provide more immediate access to the Company’s platform. A number of tech companies have integrated Apteligent functionality into their own systems, including Smule and Groupon.

### Customer Relationships

Apteligent’s products are available as self-service offerings. Customers are able to register and pay for products through the Apteligent website, and are able to access the Company’s software platform within minutes, with no need for direct interaction with Company representatives.

Large enterprises, however, must negotiate their subscription packages with members of the Apteligent sales team to ensure that their requirements are met. The Company also works directly with third-party developers in creating integrated solutions for its customers.

Apteligent provides a range of training resources to its customers through its website, including webinars, infographics and white papers, and lists events that it will attend so that customers can interact with the Company in person.

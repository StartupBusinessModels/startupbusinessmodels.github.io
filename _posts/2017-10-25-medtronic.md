The Company’s research and development costs are particularly significant, amounting to $1.6 billion in 2015, around 8.1% of the Company’s total sales.

Medtronic also operates a network of offices across and education centres which incur costs in relation to rental and utilities.

### Revenue Streams

Medtronic generates revenue through the development and sale of medical devices and treatments. Its revenue is divided into four business groups: the Cardiac and Vascular Group, the Restorative Therapies Group, the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group and the Diabetes Group.

Medtronic’s largest revenue generator is the Cardiac and Vascular Group, which sells products designed to treat cardiac diseases, provides fee-based data management and reporting solutions – namely its HEARTmark Service, Rethinking Blood Conservation Initiative and Connect HF Solution – and medical operations optimisation services. This business segment generated $9.4 billion in 2015, accounting for around 46% of Medtronic’s total annual revenue. Medtronic’s Restorative Therapies Group – which develops and sells medical devices and implants used in the treatment of the spine and musculoskeletal system, implantable neurostimulation and targeted drug delivery systems, and products and therapies designed to treat ear, nose, and throat diseases – accounted for approximately 33% of the Company’s annual revenue in 2015, generating $6.7 billion.

Medtronic’s Minimally Invasive Therapies Group and Diabetes Group accounted for 12% and 9% respectively, generating $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion in annual revenue. These proportions may change, however, as 2015 revenue figures covered only one quarter of operations following Medtronic’s acquisition of Covidien, which now operates as the Company’s Minimally Invasive Therapies Group.

Businessmodel of ProSiebenSat1 Media
-------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

ProSiebenSat.1 Media provides a range of services that are targeted at different customer segments.

 * Cable network, satellite, IPTV operators, television corporations and digital media platforms, to which the Company distributes and licenses original programming content;
* advertising agencies, commercial organisations, and brand marketers, to which the Company provides traditional television advertising, digital marketing and video marketing solutions; and
* general consumers, to which the Company provides pay-per-view and subscription media services and e-commerce products.
 ProSiebenSat.1 Media’s broadcast operations primarily serve customers across German-speaking Europe, notably Germany, Austria and Switzerland, with the Company’s native Germany representing its largest market. The Company’s other services are largely targeted at the US and UK markets.

### Value Propositions

ProSiebenSat.1 Media provides value to its customers through the quality of its original content, its range of advertising and marketing solutions and large audience, and its broad distribution network.

### Channels

ProSiebenSat.1 Media operates a website at www.ProSiebenSat1.de, where customers are able to find information on the Company’s products and services. The Company also operates video streaming and on-demand services through its www.prosieben.de and www.maxdome.de domains.

Across its core broadcast markets in German-speaking Europe, the Company operates several free-to-view television channels, including SAT.1, ProSieben, Kabel Eins, Sixx, SAT.1 Gold and ProSieben MAXX. The Company aims to have a global reach. To this end it acquired US-based multi-channel network CDS in 2015, which it merged with its own Studio71 multi-channel network.

Additionally, ProSiebenSat.1 Media operates its own international sales and distribution teams, through its dedicated sales arm SevenOne Media and SevenOne Adfactory, and operates 15 production companies across six countries. The Company also has a number of external distribution partnerships in place as a means of extending its sales reach.

### Customer Relationships

ProSiebenSat.1 Media’s customers are able to access the Company’s consumer-focused products – namely its programming content and online platform – on a largely self-service basis. Customers are able to view the Company’s broadcast channels free of charge, can register for subscription services autonomously online and can manage pay-per-view services on an independent basis.

The Company’s advertising, marketing and distribution services, however, require a greater degree of personal care. ProSiebenSat.1 Media aims to provide a bespoke, personalised service to its advertising customers, with a focus on comprehensive and tailored customer consultation, as well as marketing and market research findings, and enters into long-term extended licence agreements with many of its content providers. These agreements are principally established through direct contact with ProSiebenSat.1 Media sales representatives.

ProSiebenSat.1 Media publishes a range of news content on its website, including press releases and corporate news articles, and maintains a strong social media presence through its Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn accounts, through which it is able to interact directly with customers and consumers.

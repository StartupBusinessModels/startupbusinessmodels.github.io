 ### Channels

Sempra Energy operates a website at www.sempra.com, through which it provides information on its various services, activities, and projects. The nature of the Company’s services, however, is not conducive with the operation of an online sales channel.

The Company deals with its clients directly through an in-house sales force, which is organised across the Company’s separate operating segments and geographic operating regions. Sempra Energy has offices across the US, Mexico, Chile and Peru.

To a lesser extent, Sempra Energy also utilises the distribution and sales services of third-party energy and utility wholesalers and power generation companies.

Across all of its operating segments Sempra Energy seeks to establish longstanding customer relationships, with a view to securing recurring business.

Businessmodel of Tableau Software
----------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Tableau has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offering at any organization that wants data visualized, and its clients range from sole proprietors to global corporations. Its customers operate in a wide range of industries, including retail, media/entertainment, business services, financial services, manufacturing, energy and telecommunications, life sciences and healthcare, and education.

### Value Proposition

Tableau offers two primary value propositions: performance and brand/status.

The company has demonstrated strong performance, as indicated by customer testimonials. The company HotelQuickly, with a mobile app of the same name, used Tableau’s software to reduce analytics timelines, identify new ways of viewing data, and carry out faster business responses. The company Marchex used the software to increase productivity and improve data communication.

The company has established a powerful brand as a result of its performance. As of December 2015 it had over 39,000 customer accounts of all industries and sizes in more than 150 countries. High-profile clients include Cisco, Capital One, Wells Fargo, and Deloitte. Between 2013 and 2015, its revenues grew by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67.7%. Lastly, Tableau has won many honors, including recognition as "Best of 2005 for Data Analysis" (PC Magazine), "Best Overall in Data Visualization" (DM Review), “Best Business Intelligence Solution“ (Software & Information Industry Association), and a leader position in the 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms.

### Channels

Tableau’s main channel is its direct sales force, which it uses to acquire most of its customers. The group includes the inside sales team, which is based in regional sales hubs and manages smaller accounts, and field sales teams, which are spread throughout various continents and are primarily responsible for targeting large enterprises. The company also sells its products through indirect channels such as resellers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), technology vendors, and independent software vendors (ISVs). Indirect channels account for less than 10% of its focus.

The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, e-mail and search engine marketing, hosting of webinars and seminars, publishing of analyst reports, white papers, and case studies, and attendance of trade shows and conferences. Tableau also hosts its own annual Tableau Customer Conference which educates and encourages networking among its users.

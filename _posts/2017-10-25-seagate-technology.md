Businessmodel of Seagate Technology
------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Seagate has a segmented business model, with customers who have slightly different business needs. It markets its offerings to two groups: Consumers and Enterprises.

### Value Proposition

Seagate offers two primary value propositions: cost reduction and brand/status.

The company’s lean operations have enabled it to offer less pricey products than those of its competitors. It seeks out the least expensive components from its suppliers. It also was one of the earliest companies to utilize Southeast Asian manufacturers, a tactic that enabled Japanese firms to take over the floppy disk drive category. This strategy helped Seagate beat the prices of Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, and others, facilitating its dominance of the hard-disk drive sector.

The company has built up a formidable brand as a result of its strong performance. It has achieved numerous industry “firsts”. These include introducing the first 5.25-inch hard-disk drive; being the first corporation to ship one billion HDDs; introducing the first hard disk with a spindle speed of 10,000 RPM (the Cheetah 4LP); and producing over one billion magnetic recording heads. It has also received recognition on prominent lists – for example, in 2006 *Forbes* named it “Company of the Year” for being the best-managed firm in the U.S.

### Channels

Seagate’s main channel is retail stores, through which it acquires customers. Specific stores where its products are sold include Best Buy, Office Depot, Staples, Costco, and Sam’s Club. The company also sells its products through its website and the sites of online retailers such as Amazon, Dell, and TigerDirect.com.

### Customer Relationships

Seagate’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service nature. Customers utilize its products while having limited interaction with employees. The company’s website includes a wide variety of resources for self-help purposes, including articles, product documentation, videos, and answers to common questions. That said, there is a community component in the form of a forum where advice can be received from peers.

Businessmodel of Cavium Networks
---------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Cavium has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company specializes in providing MIPS-based and ARM-based video, network, and security processors. It primarily sells its offerings to providers of wireless, storage, networking, and consumer electronic equipment. In 2015, five of its customers accounted for more than half of its revenues (55.3%).

### Value Proposition

Cavium offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, customization, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of semiconductors. Its offerings enable storage, communications, intelligent networking, security, and video applications. The processors can provide functionality in broadband/consumer, enterprise, service provider, and data center equipment. They range in speed from 1Gbps to 100Gbps.

The company offers customization by providing products that are “systems on a chip”, or SoCs. They include a thoroughly integrated architecture, multiple or single processor cores, and customizable software based on a wide range of standard operating systems.

The company has established a strong brand because of its success. Its customers include many prominent firms, including Cisco, IBM, Motorola ECC, Juniper, Nokia, Radisys, Qualcomm, Alcatel-Lucent, and Citrix. It has won many prestigious honors, including the HPC Wire Editor’s Choice Award (2015), the Golden Bridge Award (2013), placement on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 (2014), and recognition as the “Most Respected Public Semiconductor Company” by GSA (2012).

### Channels

That said, there is a community element in the form of a section for discussion groups and a personal assistance component in the form of e-mail support.

### Key Activities

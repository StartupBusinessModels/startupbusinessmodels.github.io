Cornerstone OnDemand has a segmented market business model, with customer groups that have slightly different needs. The company targets its offerings at enterprises, public sector organizations, and nonprofits.

### Value Proposition

Cornerstone OnDemand offers four primary value propositions: convenience, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.

The company offers convenience by making life simpler for clients. Its solution is cloud-based, enabling clients to reduce maintenance and IT costs and receive automatic updates.

Lastly, the firm offers a marketplace through which clients can purchase prebuilt integrations to extend its functionality.

The company demonstrates strong performance through tangible results. Specific examples of positive outcomes for clients include the following:

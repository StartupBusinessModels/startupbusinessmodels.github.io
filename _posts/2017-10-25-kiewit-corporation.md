Businessmodel of Kiewit Corporation
------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Kiewit has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company completes construction and engineering projects for firms of all industries and sizes.

### Value Proposition

Kiewit offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, risk reduction, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has significant experience completing projects in a broad range of areas, particularly building, mining, oil/gas/chemical, power, transportation, and water/wastewater.

The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality standards. It created a formal quality program through which it does the following:

 * Creates work plans that describe the means and methods of performing its work. Pre-activity meetings com­municate how its work plans fulfill contract, design, and client requirements.
* Identifies and immediately reports quality issues as they occur. If there is an issue, root cause analysis is performed to elimi­nate the causes of quality issues and prevent future occurrence.
* Ensures that supervisors and craftsmen continuously check work as it is performed by direct reports, ensuring that it is built “right the first time.”
 The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It is one of the largest construction and engineering firms in the U.S. It is a *Fortune *300 company and generated revenues of over $9 billion in 2015. It claims to have virtually unlimited bonding capacity and to be one of the few construction firms able to compete for billion-dollar mega-projects. Lastly, it has won a number of honors, including the following:

 * Recognition as one of America’s Best Large Employers by *Forbes*

 ### Value Proposition

The company creates accessibility by making its service widely available. It markets its properties on various search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing so they can be exposed to more people. Booking.com also increases access by providing a wide variety of options. Its properties include everything from small bed and breakfasts to executive apartments to five-star luxury suites. Further, It is capable of advertising properties on its website in 41 different languages.

It does not charge any reservation, administration, or other fees to property renters. It guarantees that it offers the best available short-term rental rates in a given area. In many situations rooms can be cancelled at no cost. Lastly, the site lists new deals daily, and consumers who subscribe to its mailing list can obtain secret deals offering up to 50% in savings.

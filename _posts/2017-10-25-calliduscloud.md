Businessmodel of CallidusCloud
-------------------------------

### Customer Segments

CallidusCloud has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes. That said, many of its clients are in the telecommunications, insurance, banking, and technology sectors.

### Value Proposition

CallidusCloud offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, risk reduction, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It provides a comprehensive solution that enables clients to identify the right leads, enable sales forces, ensure proper territory and quota distribution, streamline sales compensation, and configure price quotes.

The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality and security standards, as follows:

Continuous Testing – The company regularly conducts penetration testing and vulnerability assessments on its applications and infrastructure. Applications are scanned on a weekly basis against the Open Web Application Security Project’s top security flaws, and every quarter third-party security experts carry out comprehensive vulnerability scans.

Published Audits – The company operates under SSAE 16 SOC 1 and SOC 2 certified controls framework, the data center audit standard that assesses data center operational efficiency and design across various trust criteria. The audit reports are completed annually.

Integrated Compliance Framework – The company maintains strict procedures regarding all activities in its information processing environment. It has aligned itself with ISO 27001 for Information Security, ITIL for Service Delivery, and US EU Safe Harbor/PIPEDA/UK ICO for Data Protection and Privacy. Where these standards overlap, Information Security ISO 27001 takes precedence.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has more than 5,200 clients, including prominent firms such as Barclays, CDW, Nokia, and Philips. A survey it conducted showed that it had a 93% approval rating among its customers. Lastly, it has won many honors, including:

 * Grand Stevie Awards for Organization of the Year and Best New Product or Service of the Year (Content Management Solution and Marketing/Public Relations Solution) in 2016

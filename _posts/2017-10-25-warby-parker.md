### Revenue Streams

Warby Parker generates revenue through the design, manufacture, and sale of glasses and sunglasses to customers across North America. The Company has two revenue streams:

 Warby Parker remains a privately-owned company, and as such dos not publish its financial results on its website. Reports suggest, however, that in 2015 the Company generated more than $100 million in annual revenue, up considerably on the $35 million recorded by the Company just two years earlier. The majority of the Company’s revenue appears to be derived through its online retail portal, however, the Company’s physical outlets account for a growing portion of its annual sales.

Businessmodel of True Ventures
-------------------------------

### Customer Segments

True Ventures has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its services at early-stage technology startups.

### Value Proposition

True Ventures offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing funds to early-stage firms. Most venture capital outfits focus on raising funds for later-stage startups, limiting opportunities for young entrepreneurs. However, True Ventures was founded on a mission to nurture newer companies. It meets these startups when they are in a formative phase, with a first investment of around $1 million - $3 million.

The company fosters innovation by taking risks. Investing in newer startups has enabled it to position itself ahead of cutting-edge markets such as the connected devices, robotics, 3D printing, machine learning, and autonomous vehicle industries. It purposely seeks out firms that think disruptively.

The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It manages about $1.3 billion in investor capital and has funded over 220 companies featuring 7,000 portfolio team members. These include firms such as FitBit, Puppet, Blue Bottle Coffee, Bandcamp, Namely, and Ring.

### Channels

True Ventures’ main channel is its business development team. The company promotes its offering through its social media pages and participation in conferences.

### Customer Relationships

True Ventures’ customer relationship is primarily of a dedicated personal assistance nature. The company assists clients through guidance from assigned personnel.

That said, there is also a self-service component in the form of “True University”, a section on its website that features videos of speeches on entrepreneurship from engineers, salespeople, designers, and marketing managers.

### Key Activities

True Ventures’ business model entails providing capital to early-stage startups and helping them grow in value.

### Key Partners

True Ventures does not maintain any formal partnership programs or have any partners of note.

### Key Resources

True Ventures’ main resource is its fund of $1.3 billion, which it uses to invest in early-stage firms. It depends on human resources in the form of advisors to guide clients in their use of the funds.

### Cost Structure

True Ventures has a value-driven structure, aiming to provide a premium proposition through significant personal service. Its biggest cost driver is likely investment acquisition costs including expenses for personnel, travel, and due diligence.

### Revenue Streams

True Ventures has two revenue streams:

 * Management Fees – Fees charged to startups for having their assets professionally managed. They are typically determined as a percentage of the fund’s capital commitments, and are paid on an annual basis.
* Carried Interest – A share of the profits that startups earn from an investment.

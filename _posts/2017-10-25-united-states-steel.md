Despite its online presence, US Steel does not offer services or products to its customers on a self-service basis.

The Company also provides more general support services, with customers able to contact the Company’s personnel over the phone or via email.

### Cost Structure

US Steel incurs costs in relation to the procurement of raw materials and the management of its supply chain, the operation of its production and processing facilities, the operation and maintenance of its logistics and distribution infrastructure, the management of its partnership, and the retention of its personnel.

### Revenue Streams

US Steel generates revenue through the sale of various steel products to industrial and commercial customers across North America and Europe. This includes sales contracts for the distribution of slabs, rounds, strip mill plates, sheets, tin mill products tubing, and mechanical tubing.

In 2015 US Steel generated annual sales of $11.57 billion, down considerably on the $17.51 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. The Company attributed this decrease in sales to decreased shipment volumes and lower average realised prices as a result of challenging market conditions.

The majority of US Steel’s 2015 revenue was generated by the Company’s Flat-Rolled Products segment, which accounted for 8.29 billion in net sales. The bulk of the remaining sales were generated by the US Steel Europe segment, which recorded sales for the year of $2.32 billion.

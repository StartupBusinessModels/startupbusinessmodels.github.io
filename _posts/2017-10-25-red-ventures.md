Businessmodel of Red Ventures
------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Red Ventures has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at service-oriented brands, with a special focus on those providing home insurance, consumer, business, automotive, remodeling, financial, and educational services.

### Value Proposition

Red Ventures offers three primary value propositions: convenience, accessibility, and brand/status.

The company offers convenience by making operations simpler for its clients. It provides end-to-end support for the customer lifecycle, all the way from demand generation to sale closure. It accomplishes this task through the use of proprietary technologies and advanced web analytics.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. While many similar competitors specialize in telephone sales, online marketing, or building technology infrastructure, it maintains expertise in all of those areas. It has also diversified its services by acquiring numerous firms, including Soda (a family of online brands) and Imagitas (a marketing services organization).

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It bills itself as the largest technology-enabled platform in the U.S. for growing sales and marketing businesses. It has over 3,000 employees and has grown at an average of 30% year-over-year. It has a number of prominent clients, including DirecTV, Premier Growth Solutions, and ADT Security Services. Lastly, it has won many honors, including recognition as one of the top 10 “Best Places to Work in Charlotte“ for eight years in a row and a ranking as one of the top 20 fastest-growing companies in the U.S. on the Inc. 500 list.

### Channels

Businessmodel of Johnson & Johnson
-----------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Johnson and Johnson sells its products to a range of customers across the consumer, healthcare and pharmaceutical markets. The Company’s three distinct operating segments have slightly different target markets:

 * The Company’s Consumer segment markets its products to the general public and sells both to retail outlets, online retail chains, and distributors across the world;
* The Company’s Pharmaceutical segment sells its prescription medications directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals; and
* The Company’s Medical Devices segment sells its products to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, physicians, eye care professionals, and specialist care clinics, including in the fields of orthopaedics, general surgery, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes care.
 Johnson and Johnson serves a global customers base. Its largest single market, however, is the US, which accounts for a little more than half of the Company’s total sales. Europe, and Asia Pacific and Africa are also significant markets for Johnson and Johnson products.

### Value Propositions

Johnson and Johnson provides value to its customers in the following ways:

 * Its brand reputation and industry standing, being one of the largest and most well-known companies of its kind in the world, associated with a range of high-profile and quality brands;

Johnson and Johnson makes the majority of its sales through its own in-house direct sales force, organised both by geographic region and by business segment. The Company operates offices across the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa, through which it is able to deal directly with local customers.

Johnson and Johnson’s own direct sales teams are supported by a network of channel partners, including independent sales agents, distributors and resellers, particularly in jurisdictions where the Company itself does not maintain a significant presence.

Additionally, Johnson and Johnson offers a range of free health and wellbeing mobile applications, through which it can reinforce its brand identity among consumers.

The Company’s direct sales teams consult directly with customers, establishing the individual circumstances and requirements of each customers, with a view to securing recurring business.

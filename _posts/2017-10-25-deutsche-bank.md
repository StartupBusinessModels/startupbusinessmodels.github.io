-------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Deutsche Bank provides a large portfolio of services designed to serve a broad spectrum of clients. The Company’s four core operating segments target different customer segments:

 * Corporate Banking and Securities, which serves corporate clients and investors;
* Private and Business Clients, which serves large retail clients and high-net-worth individuals;
* Global Transaction Banking, which serves medium and large commercial businesses, public bodies, and financial institutions; and
* Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management, which serves high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices.
 Deutsche Bank’s principal market is its native Germany and Western Europe. The Company, however, serves clients globally, including customers across the following geographic segments: Eastern Europe, North America, Central and South America, Asia Pacific, and Africa.

### Value Propositions

Deutsche Bank provides value to its clients in the following ways:

* Its technical expertise and experience, with the Company employing highly-qualified, specialist staff across its core operating divisions, and appointing only experienced industry executives;

 ### Channels

Deutsche Bank operates a website at www.db.com, through which it provides information on its various products and services, and its activities. The Company provides online and mobile banking services that allow customers of the Company’s Private and Business Banking segment to access information and certain financial products and operations.

Much of Deutsche Bank’s Private and Business Banking segment services can also be provided through the Company network of 2,790 branches across Germany and abroad, as well as through its customer contact centres. The Company’s branch and customer contact centre operations are supported by network of self-service terminals.

Deutsche Bank’s more complex services, particularly its wealth management and commercial banking products, are sold through the Company’s dedicated sales teams, which are organised geographically. While the Company principally develops and markets its own products and services across Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Americas, it also markets services through independent financial agents, and country-specific distribution and cooperation agreements with local operators and third-party distributors.

### Customer Relationships

The Company collaborates on an ongoing basis with its larger clients, with a view to establishing longstanding relationships.

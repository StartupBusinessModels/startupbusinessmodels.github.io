### Value Propositions

DST provides value to its clients in the following ways:

 * Its industry standing and reputation, with the Company established as a leading provider of advisory and technology services to a diverse client base, serving a number of high-profile clients across multiple industries;
* Its broad portfolio of services and solutions, with the Company offering an extensive range of services and solutions – including investment advisory, asset distribution, and healthcare administration services – to customers across the financial services, healthcare, and corporate sectors;

 ### Channels

DST operates a website at www.dstsystems.com, through which it provides information on its services, solutions, target industries, and operating locations. The Company does not operate an online sales channel, nor does it appear to provide an online client portal through which customers can access account details and tools.

DST principally makes sales through its own in-house direct sales force, which is organised both by business segment and geographic region. The Company’s sales personnel operate out of the Company’s network of sales and administrative offices, including locations in Australia, the US, Canada, the UK, China, India, Hong Kong, Ireland, South Africa, Ireland, and Thailand.

DST does not appear to utilise the services of third party resellers, distributors, and sales agents to a significant extent. The Company, however, does appear to utilises such providers in certain markets where it is not well-represented directly.

### Customer Relationships

Despite its online presence, DST does not provide services and solutions to clients on a self-service basis. Instead, the Company makes its sales through a direct sales force, the members of which consult closely with clients in order to establish the individual requirements and circumstances of each client.

The Company seeks to tailor its services where possible, agreeing custom service contracts on a case-by-case basis. DST seeks to establish longstanding relationships, with its contracts often extending to multiple years.

DST offers ongoing support to its clients, with many larger customers having their own dedicated account management teams. Clients are able to contact personnel at the relevant regional office over the phone or via email in order to access personalised assistance, or can make more general enquires through an online contact form.

The Company additionally operates web support portals for its various target industries, through which clients can access a range of online resources.

Additionally, DST operates news and insights section, through which it provides relevant ad timely industry information to its clients. It also publishes a list of its upcoming events, providing clients the opportunity to interact with DST representatives in person.

### Key Activities

DST is a provider of technology-based information processing and servicing solutions. The Company offers its services primarily in the form of unified data management, business processing and customer communications solutions.

The Company aligns its operations into three reportable business segments: Financial Services, through which it provides investor and asset distribution services to companies within the financial services industry; Healthcare Services, through which it provides medical and pharmacy benefit solutions, including aid information processing, quality of care, cost management and payment integrity services, to customers in the healthcare sector; and Customer Communications, through which it offers integrated print, mail and electronic solutions to a range of corporate and commercial clients. DST is based in the US, its principal market. It also serves clients across markets in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, notably Canada, Australia, and the UK.

### Key Partners

DST works in close collaboration with a network of partner companies and organisations across its three reportable business segments. These partners can be organised broadly into the following categories:

Businessmodel of Boehringer Ingelheim
--------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Boehringer Ingelheim serves customers from within the healthcare, pharmaceutical and animal health industries, as well as the general consumer market. Its end customers can be categorised broadly as follows:

 * Healthcare organisations, including medical institutions and practitioners to which the Company provides a range of prescription medications;
* General consumers, for which the Company produces over-the-counter medicines for a range of minor ailments and illnesses;
* Veterinary organisations, including veterinary practices and practitioners, to which the Company provides a range of preventative and curative animal health solutions; and
* Pharmaceutical companies, to which Boehringer Ingelheim provides full-service contract manufacturing services.
 Boehringer Ingelheim sells a proportion of its products to distributors, agents, affiliates and resellers, which are then authorised to market and sell the Company’s products to end customers.

Boehringer Ingelheim is a large multinational company with offices across the world. While it is based primarily in Europe, its customers are not limited by jurisdiction, with the Company serving customers across Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas and Australasia.

### Value Propositions

Boehringer Ingelheim provides value to its customers through its established reputation as a provider of quality and reliable products, its efficient contract manufacturing services, and its commitment to research and development.

Boehringer Ingelheim is one of the largest and oldest pharmaceutical companies in the world, and has established itself as a leader in its field.

The Company devotes a significant proportion of its revenue each year to research and development, in a bid to ensure it provides the most up-to-date products to its global customer base.

### Channels

Boehringer Ingelheim operates a website at www.boehringer-ingelheim.com where customers can find information on the Company’s products and services. Boehringer Ingelheim, however, does not operate an online sales channel. The Company principally makes sales through its own direct sales team, which deals with the Company’s institutional customers.

In countries where Boehringer Ingelheim has a less significant presence, notably in the Middle East and North Africa, the Company utilises a network of authorised distributors, independent sales agents, resellers and affiliates to extend its sales reach. According to its own information, the Company has 146 affiliates worldwide.

Boehringer Ingelheim reaches its general consumer customers through various pharmacy chains.

### Customer Relationships

Boehringer Ingelheim does not provide any self-service offerings to its customers. The Company’s institutional customers within the healthcare and veterinary care sectors deal directly with members of the Boehringer Ingelheim sales team. The Company employs a dedicated team of representatives that interact directly with medical institutions and practitioners to market and sell the Company’s products.

Customers of Boehringer Ingelheim’s contract development and manufacturing services also deal directly with Company representatives as is necessary in accurately establishing their individual requirements. End consumers are only able to access the Company’s prescription and over-the-counter products through certified medical and pharmaceutical practitioners.

Boehringer Ingelheim makes information available to its customer through its website, including details that enable customers to contact the Company directly with feedback and enquiries. The Company also has accounts with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn and Pinterest through which it can interact directly with its customers.

### Key Activities

Boehringer Ingelheim is a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company. The Company researches, develops, manufactures, and markets human and veterinary pharmaceutical products in its native Germany and internationally across Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas and Australasia.

Businessmodel of QuintilesIMS
------------------------------

### Customer Segments

QuintilesIMS provides a broad range of services to commercial and institutional customers operating in the healthcare and pharmaceuticals sectors. The Company’s customers principally fall into the following categories:

 * Pharmaceutical, including small, mid-size domestic and regional pharmaceutical companies, and multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical enterprises; and
* Other Healthcare, including medical device manufacturers, diagnostic companies, and healthcare providers, including clinics, large hospitals, and health systems.
 No single customer accounted for 10% or more of QuintilesIMS’s consolidated service revenues in 2015. The Company has historically derived a significant portion of its service revenues from a relatively limited number of major projects or customers, and, as biopharmaceutical companies continue to outsource large projects to a limited number of providers, this concentration of business could increase.

QuintilesIMS serves an international customer base, spanning its domestic market of the US, as well as markets across Europe, Asia, Japan, Canada, Africa, and Latin America.

 * Its reputation and track record, with the Company established as a reliable provider of biopharmaceutical development services and commercial outsourcing services, serving a large client base, including high-profile, multinational pharmaceutical businesses;

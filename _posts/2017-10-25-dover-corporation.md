The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired hundreds of firms over time, including over 70 businesses between 1998 and 2002 and almost 25 firms between 2008 and 2012. This strategy has enabled it to expand its capabilities and diversify its portfolio.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It has 26,000 employees and generated annual revenues of $7 billion in 2015. It has also received a number of honors, including the Transatlantic Award from the American Chamber of Commerce in Italy, which recognizes businesses that have distinguished themselves in the development of transatlantic relations.

### Key Activities

### Key Partners

Dover’s key partners are the suppliers that provide it with the raw materials it needs to manufacture its products.

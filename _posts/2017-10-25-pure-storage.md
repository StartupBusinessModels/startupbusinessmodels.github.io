 ### Channels

Pure Storage operates a website at www.purestorage.com, through which it provides information on its solutions, services, and industry focus. Pure Storage does not operate an online sales channel. The Company’s website, however, does provide an avenue through which customers are able to request an evaluation of their data storage needs and schedule a demonstration of the Pure Storage solutions. Once solutions have been provided, they are accessible as a cloud-based platform.

Pure Storage operates its own in-house sales force, which is organised by geographic region, through which it sells solutions and services directly to customers. These sales personnel operate out of the Company’s more than 30 offices spread across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, including in Sao Paulo, Taiwan, Sydney, Tokyo, Munich, London, and Milan.

While Pure Storage’s sales force is responsible for large-account management, global account coordination, and overall market development, the Company also employs a network of channel partners – including reseller and authorised service providers – to provide assistance in selling and marketing Pure Storage products and solutions.

### Customer Relationships

Pure Storage does not sell its products on a self-service basis. It does, however, enable customers to request demonstrations and evaluations through the Company’s website. Any subsequent sales, however, are made via the Company’s in-house sales personnel, who are able to provide tailored services, consulting closely with customers to ascertain their individual needs and circumstances and provide solutions appropriate to their size and industry. The Company seeks to establish lasting ties with its customers and secure recurring business.

On its website, Pure Storage provides a range of online support resources to its customers, including data sheets and user guides. Customers can additionally obtain personalised responses to queries and complaints through the Company’s online support ticketing system, as well as over the phone. The Pure Storage website also hosts community forums and discussion boards, where customers can interact with one another and collaborate on problems.

Customers are also able to interact directly with Pure Storage through its various social media accounts, including with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, and GitHub.

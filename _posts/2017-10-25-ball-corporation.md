The Company arranges sales of its packaging products through direct consultation with its customers, establishing the details of each individual sales and distribution contract. The Company primarily sells metal beverage containers under multi-year supply contracts, developing longstanding customer relationships with major customers, and agreeing long-term supply contracts.

Businessmodel of Splashtop
---------------------------

### Customer Segments

Splashtop has a segmented market business model, with customer segments that have slightly different business needs. The company targets its offerings at consumers and large organizations (businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and non-profits).

### Value Proposition

Splashtop offers three primary value propositions: convenience, accessibility, and brand/status.

The company offers convenience by making computing easier for customers. Its solution enables users to remotely connect to and control their desktop PCs from their mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. They can interact with the computer using intuitive touch-to-click controls. The solution can also create connections between devices connected to various networks -- for example Wi-Fi or 3G. No proximity between devices is necessary.

The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. Its application is available for Apple iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch), Android devices (including Nook and Kindle Fire), BlackBerry PlayBook, HP TouchPad, and Windows and Mac computers.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. Its application has been downloaded by more than 18 million people and adopted by thousands of organizations. Its prominent customers include Target, AT&T, DuPont, NEC, and Harvard University. Splashtop‘s manufacturing partners have shipped the program on over 100 million devices. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the “Most Innovative Product” award from *PC World*, the ”Best of 2012 CES” award from *LAPTOP* Magazine, and the “Best of What’s New” honor from *Popular Science*.  It is the only firm to win the “Ones to Watch” Emerging Companies award from NVIDIA two years in a row (2012 and 2013).

### Channels

Businessmodel of Sumo Logic
----------------------------

### Customer Segments

Sumo Logic has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. It targets its offerings at companies seeking log management and analytics services.

### Value Proposition

Sumo Logic offers three primary value propositions: convenience, performance, and brand/status.

The company offers convenience to its customers. It is cloud-based, meaning that little is required in terms of set up and maintenance and users can easily receive updates. Its solution has an analytics engine cluster that patterns together, enabling users to quickly identify problematic trends.

The company has demonstrated strong performance for its clients. Its service analyzes over 100 petabytes of data and conducts more than 20 million searches daily, delivering tens of millions of insights each day. This makes it one of the most powerful machine data analytics solutions.

The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It serves over 1,000 customers, including many members of the *Fortune* 500 such as Microsoft, Adobe, Kaiser Permanente, Mattel, and Scholastic. It has also won many honors, including recognition as a “Cool Vendor” in the Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and IT Operations Analytics (ITOA) categories by Gartner (2014), the Judge's Choice and the Audience Choice Awards for Performance Monitoring at the Under the Radar Conference (2012), and placement in the Red Herring Amerias Top 100 (2012).

### Channels

Sumo Logic’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages, and participation in summits and conferences.

### Customer Relationships

Sumo Logic’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. It provides phone and e-mail support for users. It also maintains a training program that provides instructor-led courses at public sites and instructor-led, customized courses at client sites. Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component.

The company’s website provides training modules that customers can complete at their own pace. The site also offers several self-help resources, including articles, case studies, white papers, research reports, data sheets, infographics, videos, webinars, and answers to frequently asked questions. Lastly, there is a community element in the form of a peer forum.

### Value Propositions

Stratasys provides value to its customers in three key ways: the quality of its products and services, the status and standing of its brand and its commitment to innovation. Stratasys is a market leader in its field. The quality of its products and its standing within the industry is reflected by its large customer base, including a number of high-profile companies, and its partnerships with leading companies such as Adobe. These strategic alliances also help to ensure that the Company’s keeps pace with the fast-moving technology sector, always providing up-to-date and innovative solutions to its customers.

### Channels

Stratasys employs a hybrid sales model, providing both direct sales and indirect sales through a network of more than 200 channel partners, comprising resellers and distributors. The Company’s products are distributed across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.

Stratasys’s sales and services are effected principally through the following channels:

 * sales to resellers, who purchase and resell Stratasys products and provide support services for the Company’s printing systems;
* sales of systems that are marketed by independent sales agents, who operate on commission and directly handle the sale of consumables and provision of support services; and
* sales of systems, related products and services, as well as the Company’s direct manufacturing solutions service, that are made through direct contact with customers.
 There is overlap within these channels, with some independent sales agents for high-end systems also operating as distributors of our other products. Through its consumer three-dimensional printing brand MakerBot, the Company also operates an online sales channel.

### Customer Relationships

The majority of Stratasys’s products and services require a degree of personal interaction with members of the Company’s sales team or with authorised distributors. This is necessary in order for the Company to provide a service that caters to the individual needs of each customer. The Company’s consumer-focused three-dimensional printing products are available to customers on a self-service basis through the MakerBot online store.

Stratasys continues to provide a personalised service after sale, with customers able to contact customer support representatives by phone, email or online contact form. The Company also makes a range of resources available on its website, including user guides and manuals.

Additionally, customers are able to contact the Stratasys team directly through its social media accounts with Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube.

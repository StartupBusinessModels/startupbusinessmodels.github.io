This online platform is supported by a mobile application, which is available on iOS and Android devices.

Graybar primarily sells its products – which are manufactured or provided by third-parties – through a network of sales offices and distribution facilities distributed across thirteen geographical districts in the US.

Some districts have sales offices that do not carry inventory, where specialist sales teams serve clients directly. Graybar also has seven national distribution centres and ten regional distribution centres, which replenish inventories carried at the Company’s other US distribution facilities and make shipments directly to customers.

Graybar’s foreign sales are made principally through subsidiary operations in Canada and Puerto Rico, which includes sales offices and distribution centres.

### Customer Relationships

Graybar offers many of its products to customers on a self-service basis through its online store, which enables customers to browse the company’s products, make purchase orders, arrange deliveries, and manage account details without interacting directly with members of the Company’s sales and support teams.

The Company works with its customers to establish the details of sales and distribution contracts, in order to fully fulfil the requirements of each individual customer.

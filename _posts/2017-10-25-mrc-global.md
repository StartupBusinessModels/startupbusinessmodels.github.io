### Customer Relationships

MRC Global’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers use its products while having limited interaction with employees. The company establishes interfaces that directly tie clients’ IT systems into its proprietary information systems, enabling it to provide an integrated supply service. That said, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.

### Key Activities

MRC Global’s business model entails distributing PVF products and related services to its customers.

### Key Partners

MRC Global’s key partners are the 21,000 suppliers in 45 countries that provide it with the materials and equipment necessary for the manufacture of some of its products. These firms can create an account on its website to view invoices and manage various activities. The rest of its suppliers are sourced from trading companies, manufacturer representatives, and other distributors.

The company depends on third-party manufacturers to produce the products it sells. Lastly, MRC Global relies heavily on third-party carriers to ship its items from suppliers and on freight carriers for delivery.

### Key Resources

MRC Global’s main resources are its physical resources, which include its over 400 service locations in 100+ countries, its 33 valve automation centers, and its 17 regional distribution centers (RDCs). The company also has important human resources in the form of its sales force, which promotes its offerings and includes many engineers that can answer complex technical questions.

### Cost Structure

MRC Global has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is cost of sales, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and administration, both fixed costs.

### Revenue Streams

MRC Global has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from sales of its PVF products and associated services, as well as other oilfield and industrial supplies for the energy sector.

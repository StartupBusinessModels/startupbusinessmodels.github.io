The Company does not operate an online sales channel for its core products. It does, however, operate an online store at www.kelloggstore.com, through which it sells Kellogg-branded merchandise, such as apparel, homeware, and collectibles. It also operates an online customer portal and rewards program named Kellogg’s Family Rewards.

Kellogg principally sells its products through its own in-house direct sales force, which is organised by operating segment and geographic region.

Kellogg sells its products to retailers, distributors, and food service customers through its direct sales force, which consults with customers over a period of time in order to establish the details of each individual sale sand supply contract. These contract often run into multiple years, with the Company seeking to establish longstanding relationships, in particular with its major retail clients.

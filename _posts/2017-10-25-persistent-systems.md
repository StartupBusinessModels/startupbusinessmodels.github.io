The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It has acquired several companies since its founding; in the past five years alone it has purchased PRM Cloud Solutions, Citrix' Products CloudPlatform, and the digital content management solutions business of Akumina. All of these acquisitions have enabled it to significantly increase its capabilities.

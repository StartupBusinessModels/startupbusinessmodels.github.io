Businessmodel of SurveyMonkey
------------------------------

### Customer Segments

SurveyMonkey has a segmented business model, which recognizes customer segments with slightly different needs and problems. It serves the following two groups:

 * Non-Enterprise:  For individual customers, the company offers single-user accounts. A single account holder can log in, create surveys, and obtain results for analysis. These persons most commonly utilize SurveyMonkey’s free option, but can also opt to pay for a higher-level option with advanced features.
* Enterprise:  For organizations, the company has created SurveyMonkey Enterprise, which offers a multi-user account. The account holder has a single login ID that he/she shares with fellow users in the organization; this set-up enables the streamlining of billing and easier control of data. Users can then create surveys and share the results amongst each other. Enterprise users receive 24/7 email and phone support, and also have access to a “customer success team.“ SurveyMonkey Enterprise customers include 100% of the Fortune 100.

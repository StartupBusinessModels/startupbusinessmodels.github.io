Businessmodel of Malwarebytes
------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Malwarebytes has a segmented market business model, with customers that have slightly different needs. The segments are consumers, small/medium businesses, enterprises, and non-profits.

### Value Proposition

Malwarebytes offers five primary value propositions: accessibility, pricing, performance, risk reduction, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. Its solution identifies and removes malware on PCs and phones using next-generation anti-malware, anti-spyware, and anti-rootkit techology. Specific types of malware addressed include worms, rogues, bots, spyware, rootkits,  and Trojans. It integrates with a wide variety of third-party security platforms that may already be on users‘ computers. Lastly, it is available in over 30 languages, making it usable by many.

The company offers a pricing value proposition. It offers a basic version of its software for free. It also offers a 14-day free trial for its premium version. Lastly, customers who upgrade from premium to basic receive a 50% discount.

The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Its solution features a setting called “Hyper Scan Mode“ that only targets active threats, making it analyze computers at a lightning-fast speed.

The company reduces risk by maintaining high security standards. Its solution not only removes existing infections, but prevents future ones by running continuously in the background. This real-time protection enables it to easily halt attempted attacks. This task is accomplished through the use of three proprietary technologies – signature, behavior, and heuristics. Its solution also prevents malware from removing the solution itself from devices through its Chameleon technology.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. Its software has fixed over 250 million home computers, with an average of six PCs repaired every second. It has received over 200 million downloads worldwide and removed more than five billion pieces of malware. It is used by over 10,000 companies. Lastly , it has won many honors, including the following:

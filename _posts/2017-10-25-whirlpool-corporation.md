### Key Activities

### Key Partners

Whirlpool’s key partners are the suppliers who provide it with raw materials and major components for use in the manufacturing of its products.

It also depends on human resources in the form of its engineers that design, develop, and manufacture its products.

Lastly, it places a high priority on its intellectual property, considering the trademarks, licenses, and patents it owns to be valuable assets.

### Cost Structure

Whirlpool has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation and low-price value propositions. Its biggest cost driver is cost of products sold, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and administration, both fixed costs.

### Revenue Streams

Whirlpool has two revenue streams:

 2. Product Revenues – Revenues it generates from sales of its products to consumers.
4. Licensing Revenues – Revenues it generates from the royalties it receives from the licensing of its trademarks to third parties to manufacture, sell, and service certain products bearing the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, and Amana brand names.

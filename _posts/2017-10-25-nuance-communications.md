It also maintains the “Nuance University Customer & Partner Program”, which provides learning options to clients and partners. These include product and solution training, classroom and webinar-based live classes, and partner certification exams. That said, there is a self-service component in the form of online learning courses and answers to frequently asked questions on the company’s website. There is also a community element in the form of a user forum.

### Key Activities

### Cost Structure

Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and research/development, both fixed costs.

 ### Channels

Exilant operates a website at www.exilant.com, through which it provides information on its various services, solutions, target industries and operating locations. While the Company provides a range of software solutions, the Company does not operate an online sales channel. Nor does it operate an online client portal, through which customers can manage their accounts. Customers can, however, register an interest in the Company’s various products via email or through an online contact form.

Exilant makes its sales primarily through its in-house direct sales force, which is organised by geographic region. The Company maintains sales and administrative offices across Asia Pacific, Europe, and the US, including locations in India, the UK, Singapore, and Switzerland, through which its sales personnel operate.

Exilant additionally utilises the services of third party channel partners to extend its sales and marketing reach, particularly in various international markets. These partners include value added resellers, distributors, and sales agents.

### Customer Relationships

Despite its software offerings and its online presence, Exilant does not make sales to its clients on a self-service basis. The Company does, however, allow clients to register an interest in its products independently through an online contact form.

Exilant makes its sales primarily through its in-house sales force, the members of which consult closely with clients in order to ensure that their individual needs are met. Where possible, the Company seeks to provide solutions that are tailored and scaled to suit its customers on a client-by-client basis, with a view to establishing long-term relationships and securing recurring business.

Exilant offers ongoing support to its clients, who are able to contact the company over the phone, via email, or through an online contact form in order to access personalised guidance. The Company provides information on its various products and solutions on its website, but does not publish online support resources.

Exilant does, however, operate several social media accounts – including with Facebook, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter – through which it is able to publish company updates and interact directly with customers.

### Revenue Streams

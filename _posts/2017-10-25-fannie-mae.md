The servicing of mortgage loans held in Fannie Mae’s retained mortgage portfolio is typically performed by third party mortgage servicers on the Company’s behalf. Some loans are also serviced for the Company by the lenders that initially sold the loans. For loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, however, the lender or servicer must obtain the Company’s approval before selling servicing rights to another servicer.

Fannie Mae does not provide any products or services to its customers on a self-service basis. The Company’s operations are built largely on strong and longstanding relationships with its lender customers, notably large established lenders such as Wells Fargo Bank.

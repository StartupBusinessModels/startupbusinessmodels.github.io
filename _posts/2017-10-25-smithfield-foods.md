Businessmodel of Smithfield Foods
----------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Smithfield Foods has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at consumers who desire meat products.

### Value Proposition

Smithfield Foods offers two primary value propositions: innovation and brand/status.

The company embraces innovation as part of its culture. It maintains a vertically-integrated platform through which it controls all aspects of development, from conception to packing. The system allows it to consistently supply traceable and high-quality raw material. It has also enabled Smithfield to lead in areas such as sow group housing conversion and the production of ractopamine-free pork, which is of major importance for export markets.

The company has established a powerful brand due to its success. It is the world’s largest hog producer and pork processor, raising 15.8 million pigs each year and producing over 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat and over 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork annually. It maintains leading products in several packaged meats categories, with prominent brands such as Smithfield, Eckrich, Nathan's Famous, Farmland, Armour, John Morrell, Cook's, Kretschmar, Gwaltney, Curly's, Margherita, Carando, Healthy Ones, Krakus, Morliny, and Berlinki. It employs 50,000 people throughout North America and Europe and generated $14 billion in annual revenue in its most recent fiscal year. It exported products to over 40 countries around the world. Lastly, it has won a number of honors, including the following:

 * 91 awards from the North American Meat Institute (NAMI) in 2015
* Recognition as #1 in water management among meat companies by Ceres in 2015
* Recognition as Sustainable Processor of the Year by *Food Engineering *in 2014

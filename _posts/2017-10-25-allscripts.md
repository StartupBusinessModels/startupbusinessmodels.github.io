Businessmodel of Allscripts
----------------------------

### Customer Segments

Allscripts has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at Hospitals & Health Systems, Physicians & Community Practices, Retail Clinics & Pharmacies, Life Sciences Companies, Post-Acute Organizations, Insurance Firms, and Governments.

### Value Proposition

Allscripts offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, convenience, performance, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. It is one of the few healthcare information technology firms that is able to provide solutions for every major healthcare setting, ranging from individual physician practices to major academic medical groups, hospitals, and post-acute organizations such as home care, hospice, and skilled nursing facilities.

Also, many of its solutions are web-based or cloud-based, enabling customers to access them through an Internet browser, or through a mobile device on an as-needed basis.

The company offers convenience by making life simpler for customers. Its Open platform facilitates multisite integration, enabling customers to take action across care teams, care sites, and multivendor electronic health record (EHR) systems. The platform also allows customers and third parties to build applications natively without requiring costly interfaces.

The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Specific examples of positive outcomes for clients include the following:

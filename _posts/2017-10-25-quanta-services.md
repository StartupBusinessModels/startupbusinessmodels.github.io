Businessmodel of Quanta Services
---------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Quanta provides a range of network of services and solutions to a broad network of industrial and commercial customers. The Company’s clients can be organised into two principal categories:

 * Power Sector, including energy generators, renewable energy businesses, power transmission companies, and power distribution and marketing companies; and
* Oil and Gas Sector, including national, multinational, and independent oil and gas production and exploration companies, as well as midstream and upstream oil and gas companies.
 Quanta serves a number of high-profile customers across the energy sector. This includes well-known businesses such as ConocoPhillips, Shell, Con Edison Development, PG&E Corporation, and Duke Energy Corporation. The Company also serves certain government and public institutions, including the US Department of Defense.

Quanta’s principal market is its native US. The Company, however, also serves a number of international customers across Canada, and Australia, as well as other select international markets.

### Value Propositions

Quanta provides value to its customers in the following ways:

 * Its reputation and industry standing, with the Company established as leading provider of network solutions to customers across the energy and oil and gas sectors, including a number of prominent names among its client base, such as the US Department of Defense, ConocoPhillips, and Shell;
* Its proprietary technologies, with the Company owing a portfolio of proprietary energised services tools, techniques, and design technologies that differentiate the Company’s service offerings from those of its competitors;
* Its international reach, with the Company serving a broad network of customers in its domestic market of the US, as well as a number of customers operating in Canada and Australia;
* Its industry expertise and experience, with the Company employing specialist technical personnel to work on its various solutions, as well as a team of experienced industry executives.
 ### Channels

Quanta operates a website at www.quantaservices.com, through which it provides information on its various services, solutions, and operating units. The Company does not operate an online sales channel, nor does it provide an online customer portal through which clients can manage transactions.

Quanta make sales through its dedicated in-house sales force who deal directly with clients, subsequently providing specialist technical services through highly-trained, expert personnel. The Company’s sales and service teams are based at the Company’s various offices across the US, Canada, and Australia, including its corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas.

Quanta provides services to customers directly on-site, working closely with client representatives. The Company also operates a network of facilities across its operating jurisdictions, including equipment yards, warehouses, storage spaces, and vehicle shops.

### Customer Relationships

The technical nature of Quanta’s various solutions does not allow for it to provide services to its customers on a self-service basis. The Company, instead, provides services directly to its clients through its teams of sales and service personnel. Quanta consults directly with client of a period of time in order to jointly establish a detailed and exhaustive brief covering the aims, requirements, and limitations of each individual project. The Company typically provides solutions on a project-by-project basis, with the quality of its services intended to encourage recurring business.

Quanta provides ongoing technical support services to its customers. The company’s large clients are provided their own account management teams, with which they work closely throughout the duration of each project. Customers are alternatively able to make specific enquiries and queries with the Company over the phone or via email in order to receive personalised assistance. Additionally, Quanta provides various resources through its website, including press releases and safety information.

Quanta also operates social media accounts with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn through which it is able to keep clients updated with corporate developments and interact with customers directly.

### Key Activities

Quanta is an international provider of specialty contracting services, principally comprising a range of network and infrastructure solutions designed to support customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries.

The Company aligns its operations into two reportable business segments: Electric Power Infrastructure Services, which provides a range of network solutions relating to the design and maintenance of power transmission and distribution infrastructure, and provides other engineering services; and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services, which provides a range of network solutions related to the development and transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products.

Quanta’s solutions span the entire lifecycle of power and oil and gas infrastructure, including design, installation, upgrade, maintenance, and repair. The Company principally serves customers in the US, Canada, and Australia, as well as in certain other jurisdictions around the world.

### Key Partners

Quanta works in conjunction with a broad range of companies and organisations across its two operating segments. The Company’s partners can be organised broadly into two the following categories:

* Joint Venture Partners, including various infrastructure, engineering, and construction companies with which the Company jointly provides services and solutions through mutually owned entities in various jurisdictions; and

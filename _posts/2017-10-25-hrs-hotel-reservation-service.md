 ### Channels

HRS operates a corporate website at www.hrscorporate.com, through which it provides information to existing and prospective clients regarding its services and activities, outlining the advantages of its platform.

The Company’s corporate sales are handled via this corporate portal by HRS’s in-house sales team, which can be contacted over the phone, via email, or through an online contact form. HRS has branch offices in Paris, London, Warsaw, Shanghai, Rome, Milan, Istanbul, Barcelona, Moscow, Singapore, Japan, Sao Paulo, and New York.

HRS operates its flagship online reservation portal at www.hrs.de, which is available in more than 30 languages. The Company makes a substantial proportion of its sales through this online channel, notably sales to individual professionals and small groups of travellers taking a single trip. The Company also operates an affiliate program, partnering with a network of websites and travel agents which can earn commissions by generating sales.

### Customer Relationships

HRS makes its services available to customers on a self-service basis through its online reservation portal, which can be accessed through mobile and desktop browsers. Customers are able to register for an account, make and cancel reservations, and manage their payment records through the Company’s online portal, as well as through its mobile apps, without interacting with members of the HRS sales team. The Company’s online portal typically serves one-time, single trip customers.

HRS aims to establish more long-term relationships with its corporate customers, who are required to consult directly with the Company’s sales representatives to discuss their requirements and budgets. This also enables the Company to offer its larger clients additional supplementary services, such as travel pattern analysis.

HRS provides a range of online resources to its customers, including white papers, as well as 24-hour customer service, which enables customers to contact HRS representatives by phone at any time. Corporate customers are also able to obtain personal assistance over the phone, by email or through an online contact form.

Additionally, customers can contact HRS directly through its social media accounts, including with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Google+.

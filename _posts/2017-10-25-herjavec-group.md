The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. It can address security for on-premise, cloud, and hybrid networks. It supports 40 security platforms. Lastly, it has acquired numerous companies over its lifespan, enabling it to expand its portfolio. These firms include security companies Metacomm, Sensible Security, and Cyberclix, and IT integrators SecurityLinq and Zentra Technologies. These acquisitions have enabled it to provide a broad range of capabilities.

The company offers convenience by making operations simpler for its clients. It provides an end-to-end solution that supports the entire IT security lifecycle, with four high-level steps:  consult, deliver, manage, and remediate. Its specific services include security gap assessments, consulting, implementation, managed services, networking, remediation, and incident response.

The company reduces risk by maintaining high safety and security standards. It maintains over 250 certifications across the 40 platforms it supports. These include SSAE 16 SOC 1 and SSAE 16 SOC 2, Cloud Security Alliance, and PCI (Compliant Service Provider, Qualified Security Assessor, and Authorized Scanning Vendor). Its Security Operations Centre (SOC) is operated 24x7x365.

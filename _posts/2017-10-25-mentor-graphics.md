### Customer Segments

Mentor Graphics has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings at large firms in the communications, computer, consumer electronics, semiconductor, networking, military and aerospace, multimedia, and transportation industries.

### Value Proposition

Mentor Graphics offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, performance, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options. Its customers use its products to test a broad range of electronic components and systems, including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems and software, and wire harness systems. Furthermore, its solutions are used in the design and development of many electronic products, including transportation electronics, IoT platforms, computers, medical devices, industrial electronics, manufacturing systems, and wireless communications infrastructure.

The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results. Its solutions enable clients to develop superior electronic products, increasing the accuracy of complex designs. It also helps them produce more quickly and cost-effectively, reducing product time-to-market schedules.

The company has established a strong brand due to its success. It touts itself as the only EDA provider with an embedded software solution. It recently generated annual revenues of $1.18 billion. Lastly, it has won many honors, including the “Best Design Solution” Supplier of the Year Award by TowerJazz (2015) and recognition of its Veloce Power Application as a Hot 100 Product by EDN.

### Channels

Mentor Graphics’ main channels are its direct sales team and its network of distributors and sales representatives. The company promotes its offering through its website, social media pages and participation in workshops, symposiums, and conferences.

Design Area/Foundry Partners – The company utilizes the technologies of various firms to complete or enhance its solutions. These partners fall into the following categories:

 * IC Nanometer Design – Foundry Partners
* Silicon Test & Yield Analysis
* Embedded Systems
* Functional Verification
* FPGA Partners
 Higher Education Program – The company maintains partnerships with over 1,200 colleges and universities worldwide that have engineering programs. The program aims to advance the development of skilled engineers in the electronics industry, providing the institutions with Mentor Graphics software, academic research, training, and cutting-edge design tools for classroom instruction. Specific partners include Harvard University, Princeton University, and MIT.

Term for Startup Program – The company addresses the specific needs of startups by offering economical pricing and contract terms that last 12 to 18 months. The terms provide intensive support to ensure productivity with Mentor Graphics‘ products.

### Cost Structure

Mentor Graphics has a value-driven structure, aiming to provide a premium proposition through significant personal service and frequent product enhancements.

Its biggest cost driver is research and development, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of sales/marketing and administration, both fixed expenses.

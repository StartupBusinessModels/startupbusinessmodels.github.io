 ### Channels

Ryder operates a website at www.ryder.com, through which it provides information on its various solutions and services. The Company does not appear to operate an online sales channel or customer portal for its core services. However, Ryder does operate an online channel for the sale of its used vehicles at www.usedtrucks.ryder.com. Additionally, Ryder sells its used vehicles through its own network of 59 retail sales centres across North America, as well as through a number of branch locations.

Ryder operates its own in-house sales force, organised by geographical regions and operating segment, through which it serves customers directly. The Company’s sales personnel operate out of the Company’s network of offices, including locations across the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Singapore. Ryder also operates logistics centres in Michigan and Texas, through which its dedicated carrier procurement, contract management, freight bill audit, payment services, and transportation optimisation and execution groups operate.

### Customer Relationships

Ryder operates an online self-service channel for the sale of its used vehicles, through which customers are able to browse vehicles and submit an interest in purchasing them, without interacting directly with sales personnel. Sales, however, must be completed via a representative of the Company.

The majority of Ryder’s services and solutions are provided directly through its sales, support, and consulting teams. These representatives work closely with customers in order to ensure that the Company meets the individual needs of each customer. The Company seeks to build long-term relationships with customers, with a view to securing itself as the preferred source for commercial vehicle rentals, fleet repair and maintenance, and supply chain management solutions.

Ryder provides ongoing support to customers, who are able to contact support staff directly over the phone or via an online contact form, receiving a personalised response to queries and enquiries. Additionally, customers are able to interact directly with Ryder through its social media accounts, including with Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

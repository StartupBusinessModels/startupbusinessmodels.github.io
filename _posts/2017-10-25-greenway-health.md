 ### Channels

Greenway Health’s main channel is its direct sales team. The company promotes its offerings through its website, social media pages, and participation in industry events such as conferences.

### Customer Relationships

Greenway Health’s customer relationship is primarily of a self-service, automated nature. Customers utilize its solutions while having limited interaction with employees.

The company’s website features a “Knowledge Center” section that includes useful resources such as white papers, case studies, eBooks, and webinars.

The site also has an online calculator that customers can use to determine the potential return on investment and total cost of ownership for its solutions. Despite this orientation, there is a personal assistance component in the form of phone and e-mail support.

### Key Activities

Greenway Health’s business model entails designing and developing its solutions for customers.

### Key Partners

Greenway Health’s key partners are the organizations that offer their third-party solutions within its online marketplace for use by its customers. The solutions can be integrated into its platforms.

Specific partners include: ABT Medical, Bravepoint, Century Payments, Demandforce, Entrada, Fogo Data Centers, GSG Compliance, HealthAsyst, Innovative Billing, Studycast, and Trizetto.

### Key Resources

Greenway Health’s main resources are its human resources, who include the engineers that design and develop its solutions, the sales employees that promote them, and the customer service employees that provide support.

It has relied on funding from outside sources, raising $22 million from one investor as of November 2006.

### Cost Structure

Greenway Health has a cost-driven structure, aiming to minimize expenses through significant automation. Its biggest cost driver is likely sales/marketing, a fixed cost. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support/operations and administration, both fixed costs.

### Revenue Streams

Greenway Health has one revenue stream: revenues it generates from the fees it charges to customers for subscriptions to gain access to its solutions.

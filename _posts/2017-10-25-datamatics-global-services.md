--------------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Datamatics has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer groups. The company targets its offerings at firms of all industries and sizes.

### Value Proposition

Datamatics offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, risk reduction, and brand/status.

The company creates accessibility by providing a wide variety of options. Its services address several processes, including Enterprise Document Management, Enterprise Content Management, Collaboration and Portals, BIDW & Analytics, Application Development, Support & Testing, and Mobility. It has been able to diversify its capabilities partly due to its many acquisitions. In the last few years alone, it has acquired CIGNEX and a controlling stake in Vista Infosystems.

The company reduces risk by maintaining high quality and security standards. It is the first and only information technology firm to have won the “International Asia Pacific Award” for Quality in the

Services sector. It also engages in the following initiatives:

Businessmodel of Booz Allen Hamilton
-------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

Booz Allen Hamilton provides a broad range of management and technology, consulting, and engineering services to institutional and corporate clients. The Company’s clients can be organized into three principal categories:

 * Government Bodies, including local, state, and federal government agencies in the US, as well as various international government bodies;
* Corporations, primarily companies operating in the financial services, healthcare and life sciences, energy, high-tech manufacturing, retail, and automotive industries; and
* Non-Profits, including various non-profit and charitable organisations across the world.
 Over the past year, the majority of Booz Allen Hamilton’s revenue was derived from contracts where the end client was an agency or department of the US Government. The Company supports critical missions for a diverse base of federal government clients, including nearly all of the US Government's cabinet-level departments, and federal contract vehicles. In the fiscal year 2016, the Company’s largest client was the US Army, which accounted for approximately 15% of the Company’s revenue. The Company also counts the US Navy, US Air Force, Federal Bureau of Investigations, National Security Agency, and the Department of Energy among its longstanding clients.

The US continues to be Booz Allen Hamilton’s principal market. The Company’s international clients are primarily based in the Middle East, with the Company also serving a growing presence in Southeast Asia.

### Value Propositions

Booz Allen Hamilton provides value to its clients in the following ways:

 * Its reputation and industry standing, with the Company established as one of the largest and most well-regarded providers of management and technology, consulting, and engineering services, as is demonstrated by its ability to attract significant business from numerous US Government agencies, including several branches of the US military;

 ### Channels

Booz Allen Hamilton operates a website at www.boozallen.com, through which it provides information on its various services, solutions, locations, and target industries. The nature of the Company’s tailored consulting services does not lend itself to the operation of an online sales, self-service sales channel. The Company also does not operate an online customer portal.

Booz Allen Hamilton makes sales and provides its various services through its dedicated consulting and service personnel, who are organised principally by service line, with separate units covering the Company’s management consulting, technology, engineering, strategic innovation, and product-related services. These employees operate primarily out of the Company’s international network of offices, including numerous locations across 32 US states – and Washington DC – as well as in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, South Korea, Russia, Indonesia, and Singapore.

Booz Allen Hamilton also operates a number of so-called Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, which are enclosed areas within buildings that are used to perform classified work for the US Intelligence Community. A number of the Company’s employees also operate out of facilities provided by the US Government.

### Customer Relationships

Booz Allen Hamilton does not provide services to its customers on a self-service basis, nor does it provide an online customer portal through which customers can independently manage their services.

Booz Allen Hamilton provides tailored services to its institutional, commercial, and non-profit clients. The Company’s consultants work closely with clients on an ongoing basis, seeking to deliver personalised services and solutions, and establish longstanding business relationships. Booz Allen Hamilton has already established long-running relationships with a number of government agencies, including relationships spanning more than 65 years with the US Army and the US Navy.

Booz Allen Hamilton provides ongoing support to its clients, operating dedicated client management units. Clients can also contact members of the Company’s consulting and support personnel at the relevant office, or can make more general enquiries over the phone or via an online contact form.

Additionally, Booz Allen Hamilton provides a range of online resources to its clients, notably its various industry and market insights, white papers, videos, podcasts, and studies. Clients are also able to interact with the Company, and follow its corporate developments and activities, through its social media accounts including with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

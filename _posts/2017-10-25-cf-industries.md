* Industrial entities, including chemicals producers and metals companies.
 In 2015 none of CF Industries’s customers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the year.

CF Industries’s principal market is the US, with domestic US customers accounting for around 80% of the Company’s total 2015 sales. The majority of the Company’s remaining sales are made to customers in Canada; however, CF Industries does serve customers across Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.

 ### Channels

CF Industries operates a website at www.cfindustries.com, through which it provides information on its various products, activities, and corporate developments. The Company, however, does not operate an online sales channel.

The vast majority of CF Industries’s sales are made through its own internal marketing and sales force, which is organised both product segment and by geographic region. The Company operates a network of offices and facilities, with the Company making sales across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East.

The operations of CF Industries’s in-house sales force is supported by a network of third-party channel partners, including independent sales agents and fertiliser distributors.

### Customer Relationships

CF Industries does not make any of its products available to customers on a self-service basis. Instead, customers must consult directly with the Company’s relevant in-house sales team, taking time to agree the terms of a mutually beneficial sales contract. CF Industries seeks to establish long-term relationships form its customers, with a view to securing recurring business, often agreeing multi-year sales contracts.

CF Industries provides customer support services to its clients throughout the lifespan of its sales agreements, offering personal care to existing customers in relation to production and delivery processes. Potential and existing customers are able to contact the Company’s sales and support staff directly over the phone, via email, or by mail, receiving a personal response to queries and enquiries.

Customers are able to access information on the Company’s activities, products and performance through its Insights and News portal. They are also able to interact directly with the Company through its social media accounts with LinkedIn and YouTube.

It also operates segment dedicated to the production of other nitrogen products such as diesel exhaust fluid, urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to its industrial customers, as well as compound fertiliser products. The Company also generates some revenue through the production and sale of phosphate products; however, CF Industries appears to be exiting this business.

CF Industries owns or leases six nitrogen fertiliser manufacturing facilities in the US, and two nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the UK, as well as a network of distribution terminals. The Company also has an interest in a nitrogen fertiliser manufacturing facility through Terra Nitrogen Company, and an interest in an ammonia production plant through Point Lisas Nitrogen.

### Cost Structure

CF Industries incurs costs in relation to the development of its products and processes, the operation of its manufacturing and production facilities, the purchase of supplies, the operation of its sales and distribution channels, the management of its partnerships, and the retention of its personnel.

The Company also accrued transaction costs – attributable primarily to consulting and legal services associated with various strategic agreements – totaling $56.9 million.

### Revenue Streams

CF Industries generates revenue through the production and sale of various nitrogen-based fertiliser products, as well as, to a lesser degree, of phosphate products. This includes the sale of ammonia products, granular urea products, urea ammonium nitrate solution products, ammonium nitrate products, diesel exhaust fluid, urea liquor, nitric acid and compound fertiliser products.

In 2015 CF Industries generated total net sales of $4.31 billion, down on the $4.74 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. The Company attributed this decrease to a general decline in product sales. The Company’s largest revenue generator is its ammonia products division, which generated sales in 2015 of $1.52 billion. This was followed by the Company’s urea ammonium nitrate solution division which generated annual sales in the amount of $1.48 billion.

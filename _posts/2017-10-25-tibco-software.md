--------------------------------

### Customer Segments

TIBCO has a mass market business model, with no significant differentiation between customer segments. The company targets its offerings at firms across industries and sizes.

### Customer Relationships

TIBCO’s customer relationship is primarily of a personal assistance nature. The company assists customers in the following ways:

 * Support Services – TIBCO offers 24/7/365 customer service from support centers around the world. The centers are staffed by employees well-versed in both its software products and third-party applications and platforms.
* Training Services – TIBCO offers classroom training (at Technical Learning Centers), private/customer-dedicated training, live online training, and on-demand training. Program content includes everything from fundamentals of its architecture to advice on administration of specific products. The company also operates the TIBCO Certified Professional Program, enabling students to verify their skills.
* Consulting Services – TIBCO maintains the Professional Services Group, which helps its customers plan and implement integration solutions by leveraging best practices, providing reusable components, and transferring subject matter expertise to customer implementation teams. The group includes more than 1,200 consultants in over 25 countries.
 TIBCO also operates the Executive Briefing Center, a set of facilities at which customers, partners, and other guests can meet one-on-one with its senior executives, best practice experts, and top technologists in order to discuss their challenges and collaboration opportunities.

Despite this orientation, there is a self-service component. TIBCO’s website features a Customer Support Portal with helpful resources such as product documentation and answers to frequently asked questions. It allows clients to create, update, and track service requests. There is also a community element in the form of a forum where customers can exchange information.

### Key Activities

### Key Partners

### Key Resources

TIBCO’s main resources are its human resources, who include the engineers that design and develop its software products, the service staff members that provide support, and the training/consulting staff members that provide instruction and advisory services.

### Cost Structure

TIBCO has a value-driven structure, aiming to provide a premium proposition through significant personal service and frequent product enhancements. Its biggest cost driver is likely cost of services, a variable expense. Other major drivers are in the areas of customer support and product development, both fixed costs.

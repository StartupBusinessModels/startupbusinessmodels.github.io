 ### Channels

EMCOR operates a website at www.emcorgroup.com, through which it provides information on its various services, projects, and locations. The Company does not operate an online sales channel or a customer portal.

EMCOR serves its customers directly, operating sales and service teams specific to each of its operating segments. The Company is active through more than 75 group companies present operating across 170 locations in the US and the UK.

Once contracts and sales have been agreed, the Company works directly on construction service and building service both large and small projects, including for corporations, municipalities and federal and state governmental entities, through its expansive team of specialist engineering, construction, and maintenance personnel, which manage all aspects of these projects.

EMCOR also provides construction services indirectly, by acting as a subcontractor to general contractors, systems suppliers, property managers and other subcontractors.

### Customer Relationships

EMCOR does not operate any self-service channels, beyond the information provided on its website. The Company works closely with its customers, consulting over a period of time in order to accurately establish the requirements, budget, and limitations of each project prior to the commencement of work. EMCOR collaborates with customers throughout these projects, with a view to establishing longstanding relationships.

Additionally, EMCOR provides ongoing support to its customers and makes support and service personnel available throughout the project process, with larger customers having their own account management teams. Potential and existing customers are also able to contact the Company via email and over the phone in order to receive a personalised response to enquiries.

EMCOR provides a range of information to customers through its website, publishing press releases, and news coverage. It also operates a number of social media accounts – including with Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube – through which it can provide more timely information and interact directly with customers.

EMCOR owns and operates a number of properties across the US and the UK, including more than 25 facilities spanning an area greater than 50,000 square feet, the majority of which are leased.

### Cost Structure

EMCOR incurs costs in relation to the repair and maintenance of its equipment, the procurement of materials and supplies, the payment of fees to third-party service providers, the maintenance of its It and communications infrastructure, the management of its partnerships, and the retention of its personnel.

In 2015 EMCOR recorded cost of sales in the amount of $5.77 billion, which includes the procurement and maintenance of supplies and equipment, and the procurement of services from third parties. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses – including the payment of salaries and benefits to its workforce of 29,000 employees – totaled $656.57 million for the year.

### Revenue Streams

EMCOR generates revenue through its provision of various engineering, construction and industrial services to a broad range of customers. This principally includes revenue derived from contracts relating to small and large contracts across it five operating segments.

In 2015 EMCOR generated annual revenue of $6.72 billion, up slightly on the $6.42 billion recorded by the Company in 2014. This small increase was attributed to general growth across the Company’s segments. The Company’s largest revenue generator was its United States Mechanical Construction and Facilities Services segment, which generated $2.31 billion in revenue for the year. The only other segments to generate more than $1 billion in revenue were the United States Electrical Construction and Facilities Services and United States Building Services, which recorded revenue of $1.37 billion and 1.74 billion respectively.

Businessmodel of Boston Consulting Group
-----------------------------------------

### Customer Segments

BCG has a mass market business model, with little differentiation between customers. The company targets its offerings at firms of all sizes and industries seeking management consulting services.

### Value Proposition

BCG offers four primary value propositions: convenience, customization, performance, and brand/status.

The company creates convenience by offering a three-step program for client enablement. The process involves a) identifying the capabilities necessary to win, b) developing better managers by providing them with a mix of managerial and technical skills, and c) developing next-level business platforms to maximize manager effectiveness. The program can be applied across industries.

The company offers customization through the second step of its enablement program. It develops programs with a curriculum tailored for specific managers and cohorts. For example, its “lean curriculum” has 24 modules, which are used in different combinations for different cohorts.

The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible client results. High-profile examples of these outcomes include the following:

 * An industrial engineering conglomerate used BCG’s enablement program to obtain more than $25 million worth of positive results (e.g., savings)
* A rolling stock manufacturer used BCG’s lean transformation program to decrease lead times by 70% and increase productivity by 30%
* A government agency used a new BCG operating model to increase productivity by 15%
* A pest control company used BCG’s pricing and infrastructure improvement program to drive bottom-line improvements of over 250 basis points annually
* A building products company used BCG’s lean manufacturing program to create bottom-line improvements worth over $100 million within two years
 The company has established a strong brand as a result of its success. It is one of the world’s top management consulting firms, operating 85 offices in 48 countries. Its clients include over two-thirds of the *Fortune* 500.

Businessmodel of Ross Stores
-----------------------------

### Customer Segments

Ross Stores provides apparel products and accessories for the general consumer market, serving customers across multiple demographics. According to a recent investor presentation published by the Company, Ross Stores’s target customers are predominantly female, around 75% to 80%, who appreciate good quality brands, but also enjoy shopping for bargains.

The Company’s core customers are typically from middle income households and make two or three store visits each month. Ross Stores’s chain of dd’s Discounts stores attract a younger customer base, coming from households of a more moderate income.

Through its retail chains, Ross Stores serves a large domestic customer base across the US. This includes the operation of physical retail outlets across 36 US states, with a significant presence in California, Florida, and Texas. The Company does not appear to have any significant international operations.

### Value Propositions

Ross Stores provides value to its customers in the following ways:

 * Its brand recognition and reputation, with the Company a well-known and recognisable retailer of off-price clothing and accessories, having a reputation for providing good-quality products and customer service;
* Its extensive retail network, with the Company reaching its customers through multiple sales channels, including a network of more than 1,500 physical retail outlets across 36 states under both the Ross and dd’s Discounts brands;
* Its broad merchandising and purchasing networks, with the Company maintaining relationships with a large network of vendors and manufacturers, and implementing an efficient merchandising strategy, to ensure it is able to offer high-quality products and low prices;

The Company’s operates a separate website for its dd's Discounts-branded stores at www.ddsdiscounts.com, through which it provides similar product information and a store location tool. The Company does not appear to operate an online or mobile sales channel.

Ross Stores makes its sales through its extensive chain of physical retail outlets, which are staffed by its in-store sales force who serve customers directly. The Company operates a network of more than 1,500 store locations across 36 US states, of which 1,342 are Ross-branded stores and around 193 are dd’s Discounts-branded stores.

Ross Stores situates its stores in community and neighborhood shopping centres in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, the Company groups stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising, distribution, and field management.

Ross Stores operates its own distribution infrastructure, principally comprising six regional distribution centres. This infrastructure allows the Company to stock its stores quickly and efficiently.

### Customer Relationships

Ross Stores does not offer its products to customers on a self-service basis. The extent of its self-service offerings appears to be its online store locator tools, which helps customers find stores in their area.

Ross Stores makes its sales directly to customers through its extensive retail chain, with its in-store sales personnel assisting customers personally with enquiries, questions, and concerns. The Company’s in-store staff are also able to directly handle customer complaints and product returns.
